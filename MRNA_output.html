<p style='color: green;'>you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in “part i, item a - risk factors” section of this annual report on form, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>overview we are a biotechnology company pioneering messenger rna (mrna) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines to improve the lives of patients.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>mrna medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular, membrane, or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mrna science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases, independently and with our strategic collaborators.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in january, the us food and drug administration (fda) approved the biologics license application (bla) for our covid vaccine, spikevax, for individuals years of age and older in the united states.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>spikevax is our first product to achieve licensure in the united states, and it has been authorized for use or approved by regulators in more than countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>within our platform, we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features, we call that group a “modality.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases, they share similar mrna technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles, including the desired dose response, the expected dosing regimen, the target tissue for protein expression, safety and tolerability goals, and pharmaceutical properties.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk, but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have created seven modalities to date: prophylactic vaccines; systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics; cancer vaccines; intratumoral immuno-oncology; localized regenerative therapeutics; systemic intracellular therapeutics; and inhaled pulmonary therapeutics.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have designated our prophylactic vaccines and systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modalities as our “core modalities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in these core modalities, our strategy is to invest in additional development candidates using our accumulated innovations in technology, our process insights and our preclinical and clinical experience.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our exploratory modalities continue to be a critical part of advancing our strategy to maximize the application of our potential mrna medicines.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>since our founding in, we have transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of mrna to a commercial enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mrna and lipid nanoparticle formulation, and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have established relationships with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators, which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of our manufacturing capabilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>most recently, our capabilities have come together to allow the authorization and approval of one of the earliest and most-effective vaccines against the covid pandemic.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>business highlights moderna covid vaccine on december, we received an emergency use authorization (eua) from the fda for the emergency use of the moderna covid vaccine (also referred to as mrna- and marketed under the brand name spikevax) in individuals years of age or older.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>subsequently, we have also received authorization for our covid vaccine from health agencies in more than countries and from the world health organization (who).<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>additional authorizations are currently under review in other countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in addition, we have received authorization for our covid vaccine for use in adolescents in the european union, the united kingdom, australia, canada, switzerland and other countries, and have pending applications for authorization to administer the vaccine to adolescents with regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in january, we received full fda approval for spikevax to prevent covid in individuals years of age and older in the united states.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>a booster dose of our covid vaccine at the µg dose level is authorized for use under an eua for adults years and older.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>a third dose of our covid vaccine at the µg dose level is authorized for use under an eua in immunocompromised individuals years of age or older in the united states who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the european medicines agency (ema) has also authorized a third dose of the moderna covid vaccine given at least days after the second dose to severely immunocompromised individuals years of age or older, as well as the administration of µg booster doses for individuals years of age and older.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>manufacturing scaling in, we rapidly scaled our manufacturing capabilities for our covid vaccine.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>by june, we had delivered million doses of the moderna covid vaccine to the us government.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>by end of september, we and our partners ramped up our capacity worldwide and supplied more than million doses of our covid vaccine globally.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we took measures to scale capacity at a significant pace, including the expansion of our moderna technology center (mtc) in norwood, massachusetts.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>by the end of, we had shipped approximately million doses of our covid vaccine worldwide.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in april, we announced new funding commitments to increase supply at our owned and partnered manufacturing facilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we expect these investments will allow for a doubling of drug substance manufacturing at lonza’s switzerland-based facility, a more than doubling of formulation, fill and finish and drug substance manufacturing at rovi’s spain-based facility, as well as a percent increase of drug substance at moderna’s facilities in the us when completed, the investments are also expected to result in an increase in safety stock of raw materials and finished product used to deliver committed volumes.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>access expansion we recognize that vaccine availability continues to be a challenge in many parts of the world, and we remain focused on ensuring that low-income countries have access to our vaccine.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in april, we announced additional investments to increase global supply of our covid vaccine and in may we announced an agreement with gavi, the vaccine alliance to supply up to million doses of our vaccine at our lowest tiered price, in line with our global access commitments.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>this agreement has subsequently been revised to provide up to million doses to be delivered across and.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>additionally, in october, we announced that moderna will build a state-of-the-art mrna facility in africa with the goal of producing up to million doses of vaccines each year at the µg dose level.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we also announced the first step in our long-term partnership with the african union with a memorandum of understanding to supply up to million doses of our covid vaccine to address the needs of low-income countries in africa.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in january, african union informed us that it will not exercise its option for million doses in the second quarter of, due to its expectation that existing supplies will be sufficient to meet its vaccination targets.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>program development throughout the year, we continued to build a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across our seven modalities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our longstanding approach to portfolio development, pursuing programs that have shared technology or biology, has helped us reduce risk as our pipeline has grown to programs in development, including in clinical studies as of december, beyond our covid vaccine, in we launched the second pivotal trial in our company’s history with cmvictory, a phase study of our vaccine to prevent congenital cytomegalovirus (cmv), which is the number one cause of birth defects in the us this milestone takes us one step closer to potentially bringing another important vaccine to millions of people.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we are making other significant advances across our programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our seasonal influenza vaccine showed positive interim phase data, and our respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) vaccine moved to a phase / trial of, participants in the fourth quarter of.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in oncology, our personalized cancer vaccine phase trial is now fully enrolled, and we expect a readout as early as the fourth quarter of.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we also saw early positive data from the phase study of our mrna vegf-a therapeutic with astrazeneca moving it to the next stage of clinical development.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>financial highlights we have entered into supply agreements with the us government, other international governments, gavi (on behalf of the covax facility), and the african union for the supply of our covid vaccine.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the agreements are generally subject to receipt of authorization or approval for the use and distribution of the vaccine from the relevant regulatory authority in each jurisdiction.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>under these agreements, we are entitled to upfront deposits for our covid vaccine supply, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, we had approximately billion in deferred revenue in connection with the supply agreements with the us government and other customers, which will be recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria have been met.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>for the year ended december, we delivered approximately million doses of our covid vaccine to the us government and approximately million doses to other governments, and we recognized billion in product sales.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately billion.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we are using this capital to fund operations and investing activities for technology creation, drug discovery and clinical development programs, infrastructure and capabilities to enable our research and early development activities (which includes our mtc), our digital infrastructure, creation of our portfolio of intellectual property, acquisition of key raw materials and supplies to support our commercial production quantities, development of a commercial team, expansion into global markets, funding our strategic collaborations and administrative support.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we also use this capital to fund our share repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>other business updates in may, we announced an expansion of our mtc.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the mtc has been core to our long-term strategy and has enabled us to provide the scale and flexibility to support the development of our mrna medicines and vaccines, including our covid vaccine.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>this investment will more than double the space at the mtc to approximately, square feet and allow us to continue to optimize our mrna products as we explore new pharmaceutical delivery forms such as prefilled syringes and lyophilized products.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we are also investing in a new moderna science center (msc) in cambridge, massachusetts, to create a purpose-built space to support our next chapter of discovery and serve as our principal executive offices.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the msc will integrate digital-first scientific research and development labs along with space for innovation and co-creation with our people and our partners around the world.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, the high-performance building is designed to be the most sustainable commercial lab building in cambridge.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in addition to our owned facilities in the u.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>s.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have expanded our footprint across the globe, with active subsidiaries in more than countries, including the u.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>s.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>canada, many european countries and the asia pacific region.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as moderna expands internationally, we also announced in preliminary agreements with the governments of canada and australia to bring state-of-the-art mrna manufacturing facilities to those countries to provide direct access to rapid pandemic response capabilities as well as domestically manufactured mrna vaccines against other diseases.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we began to record product sales for our covid vaccine subsequent to its authorization for emergency use by the fda and health canada in december.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>for the years ended december, and, we recognized billion and million, respectively, of product sales from sales of our covid vaccine.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>other than product sales, our revenue in and was derived from government-sponsored and private organizations including barda, darpa and the bill & melinda gates foundation and from strategic alliances with astrazeneca, merck and vertex to discover, develop, and commercialize potential mrna medicines.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, we had signed supply agreements of approximately billion for the future supply of our covid vaccine to be delivered in and and had deferred revenue of billion associated with customer deposits received or billable under these agreements.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>additional supply agreements have been agreed upon since december, and others are under discussion for and deliveries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we believe that the sars-cov- virus will evolve to an endemic phase in and as a result, we expect our product sales to be larger in the second half of than in the first half.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in addition, we expect to continue to receive funding from our contract with barda.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, the remaining available funding, net of revenue earned was million under the barda contract.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>to the extent that existing or potential future products generate revenue, our revenue may vary due to many uncertainties in future product demand, the development of our mrna medicines and other factors.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>cost of sales cost of sales includes raw materials, personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing our commercial product.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs include production materials, production costs at our manufacturing facilities, third-party manufacturing costs, and final formulation and packaging costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>cost of sales also includes shipping costs, royalties payable to third parties based on sales of our products, and charges for inventory valuation reserves.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>research and development expenses the nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following: cost to develop our platform; discovery efforts leading to development candidates; preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical development costs for our programs; cost to develop our manufacturing technology and infrastructure; and digital infrastructure costs related to our drug discovery efforts and clinical trials.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the costs above comprise the following categories: personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, investigative sites, contract research organizations, or cros, that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and in-licensing arrangements; expenses associated with developing manufacturing capabilities and acquiring materials for preclinical studies, clinical trials and pre-launch inventory, including both internal manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or cmos; expenses incurred for the procurement of materials, laboratory supplies, and non-capital equipment used in the research and development process; and facilities, depreciation, and amortization, and other direct and allocated expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform, and for discovering and developing programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects, indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are generally not recorded or maintained on a program- or modality-specific basis.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the following table reflects our research and development expenses, including direct program specific expenses summarized by modality and indirect or shared operating costs summarized under other research and development expenses during the years ended december,, and (in millions): includes a total of development candidates at december, and development candidates at each of december, and.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>program-specific expenses include external costs and allocated manufacturing costs of pre-launch inventory, mrna supply and consumables, and are reflected as of the beginning of the period in which the program was internally advanced to development or removed if development was ceased.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>a “modality” refers to a group of programs with common product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing processes.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the program-specific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs, which consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, central laboratories, investigative sites, and cros in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials, cmos, and allocated manufacturing costs of pre-launch inventory, mrna supply and consumables.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>costs to acquire and manufacture pre-launch inventory, mrna supply for preclinical studies and clinical trials are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred, and subsequently allocated to program-specific manufacturing costs after completion of the program-specific production.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the timing of allocating manufacturing costs to the specific program varies depending on the program development and production schedule.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we generally do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, costs associated with our general platform research, technical development, and other shared costs on a program-specific basis.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs were therefore excluded from the summary of program- specific expenses by modality.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>discovery program expenses are costs associated with research activities for our programs in the preclinical discovery stage, and primarily consist of external costs for cros and lab services, and allocated manufacturing cost of preclinical mrna supply and consumables.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>platform research expenses are mainly costs to develop technical advances in mrna science, delivery science, and manufacturing process design.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs include personnel-related costs, computer equipment, facilities, preclinical mrna supply and consumables, and other administrative costs to support our platform research.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>technology development and unallocated manufacturing expenses are primarily related to non-program-specific manufacturing process development and manufacturing costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>shared discovery and development expenses are research and development costs such as personnel-related costs and other costs, which are not otherwise included in development programs, discovery programs, platform research, technical development and unallocated manufacturing expenses, stock-based compensation, and other expenses.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including development of our platform, mrna technologies, and manufacturing technologies.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we expense research and development costs as incurred and cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing, and estimated costs required to complete the development of the development candidates and investigational medicines we are currently developing or may develop in the future.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development of such development candidates and investigational medicines, including, but not limited to: scope, progress, and expense of developing ongoing and future development candidates and investigational medicines; entry in and completion of related preclinical studies; enrollment in and completion of subsequent clinical trials; safety and efficacy of investigational medicines resulting from these clinical trials; changes in laws or regulations relevant to the investigational medicines in development; receipt of the required regulatory approvals; and commercialization, including establishing manufacturing and marketing capabilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as we continue to pursue our indication expansion of mrna- during the current pandemic, and continue to develop variant-specific covid vaccine candidates and our next-generation covid vaccine candidate (mrna-), we expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>at this time, the magnitude of these potential expenditures is not known.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in connection with the barda agreement to accelerate development of mrna-, grant revenue and expenses within the committed funding scope are expected to continue in.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>barda’s funding is expected to offset those expenses that are covered under the barda agreement, subject to our obtaining reimbursement from barda.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, the remaining available funding from barda, net of revenue earned was million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>changes in expectations or outcomes of any of the known or unknown risks and uncertainties may materially impact our expected research and development expenditures.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development, such as our cmv vaccine (mrna-) and our covid vaccine, generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as our investigational medicines progress through the development phases and as we identify and develop additional programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our investigational medicines, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time due to the early stage of development of our investigational medicines.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>moreover, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>selling, general and administrative expenses we started to incur sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of to prepare for commercial operations in connection with the sale of our covid vaccine, and these expenses increased throughout the course of.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for executives, finance, legal, human resources, business development and other administrative and operational functions, professional fees, accounting and legal services, information technology and facility-related costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property, or ip.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual program.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand the number of programs in development and prepare for the establishment of commercial activities both within and outside the united states.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have already incurred additional expenses related to building out a regulatory, sales and marketing team to support the sale, marketing and distribution of our covid vaccine and the expansion of our footprint across the globe, with active subsidiaries in more than countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>if we obtain regulatory approval for additional investigational medicines, and do not enter into one or more third-party commercialization collaboration and manufacturing arrangements, we will incur significant additional expenses related to building out these functions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we have a broad ip portfolio covering our development and commercialization of mrna vaccine and therapeutic programs, including those related to mrna design, formulation, and manufacturing platform technologies.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we also hold trademarks and trademark applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>costs to secure and defend our ip are expensed as incurred, and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>interest income interest income consists of interest generated from our investments in cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, and high-quality fixed income securities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>other expense, net other expense, net consists of interest expense, gains (losses) from the sale of investments in marketable securities, and other income and expense unrelated to our core operations.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>interest expense is primarily derived from our finance leases related to our moderna technology center and certain contract manufacturing service agreements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>income taxes we account for income taxes based on an asset and liability approach.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>valuation allowances are provided, if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, we maintained a valuation allowance against a portion of the state deferred tax assets based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we are subject to income tax audits and adjustments by tax authorities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the nature of uncertain tax positions is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change, which may be substantial.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions and as additional information becomes available, estimates are revised and refined.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we record reserves for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>these reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax expense.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>recently issued accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>results of operations a discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended december, compared to is presented below.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>a discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended december, compared to can be found under part ii -item of our annual report on form for the year ended december, which was filed with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on february, revenue total revenue increased by billion in, primarily due to increases in product sales.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>product sales increased by billion in from sales of our covid vaccine to domestic and international government customers and international purchasing organizations, such as gavi (on behalf of the covax facility) and the african union, subsequent to the authorization by the fda and health canada for emergency use in december.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>grant revenue increased by million, or , in, mainly due to an increase in grant revenue from barda related to our covid vaccine development in.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>operating expenses cost of sales we began capitalizing our covid vaccine inventory costs in december, in connection with an emergency use authorization from the fda and an interim order from health canada for use of our covid vaccine, and based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of mrna-.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>prior to the capitalization of our covid vaccine inventory costs, costs related to our pre-launch inventory were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we expensed million of pre-launch inventory costs in.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our cost of sales was billion, or of our product sales, in, including third-party royalties of million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>a portion of the inventory costs associated with our product sales for the year ended was expensed previously.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>if inventory sold for the year ended was valued at cost, including what was expensed as pre-launch inventory, our cost of sales for the period would have been billion, or of our product sales.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we utilized all of our pre-launch inventory during.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we expect that our cost of sales as a percentage of product sales will increase in due to higher manufacturing costs and lower average selling price per dose, driven by the expected increase in deliveries to low income countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million, or , in.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in clinical trial expenses of million, an increase in personnel-related costs of million, and an increase in consulting and outside services of million, partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing expenses of million, attributable to pre-launch inventory expensed in prior to fda authorization.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the increase in was largely attributable to the continued clinical development of mrna-.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the increase in personnel-related costs was primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees supporting our mrna- development activities as well as other research and development programs.<br>

</p><p style='color: red;'>liquidity and capital resources prior to the commercialization of our covid vaccine, we have historically funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity instruments and from proceeds from certain strategic alliance arrangements and grant agreements.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>starting in august, we entered into supply agreements with the us government, other international governments, gavi, and the african union for the supply of our covid vaccine.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>under these agreements, we are entitled to upfront deposits for our covid vaccine supply, which are initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria have been met.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, we had billion in deferred revenue related to customer deposits received or billable.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in addition, we expect to continue to receive funding from our contract with barda related to our mrna- program.<br>

</p><p style='color: green;'>we have retained earnings of billion as of december, we have significant future capital requirements including expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, operate our organization, meet capital expenditure needs, and fund our share repurchase program.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities as we continue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we also expect our expenses to increase associated with manufacturing costs, including our arrangements with our international supply and manufacturing partners.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our ongoing work on mrna-, including development of any new generations of boosters and vaccines against variants of sars-cov-, and buildout of global commercial, regulatory, sales and marketing infrastructure to support the commercialization of our covid vaccine will require significant cash outflows during, most of which may not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by our partners or collaborators.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>in addition, we have substantial facility, lease and purchase obligations.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research and development activities and potential future milestone and royalty payments by us.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of december, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through at least the next months from the issuance of the financial statements included in this annual report on form.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors including expenses related to the ongoing covid pandemic, which may adversely affect our business.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>if we fail to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be required to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, structured financings and debt financings, government funding arrangements, potential future strategic alliances from which we receive upfront fees, milestone payments, and other forms of consideration, and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and licensing arrangements.<br>

</p><p style='color: green;'>our investment portfolio comprises money market funds and marketable debt securities (including us treasury securities, debt securities of us government agencies and corporate entities, and commercial paper), which are classified as available-for-sale securities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity, and our investment policy defines allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to minimize risk exposure.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>due to the short-term maturities and low risk profiles of our investments, we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by one percentage point from levels at december, the net fair value of our marketable securities would decrease by approximately million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>foreign currency risk our revenue generating activities and operations have been primarily denominated in us dollars.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our significant foreign currency revenue exposure for the year ended december, was the equivalent of billion in euros.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>to help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented cash flow hedging and balance sheet hedging programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>cash flow hedging activities we hedge foreign currency product sales denominated in euros, including the use of foreign exchange forward contracts or purchased options.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we hedge our cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our foreign exchange contracts as of december, carried at fair value, had maturities of up to months.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>balance sheet hedging activities we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, our outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives, carried at fair value, had maturities of less than three months.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted revenue and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material, a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, a hypothetical adverse movement of percent in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollars across all maturities would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of approximately million.<br>

</p><p style='color: red;'>the trial is active and enrolling patients.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>other business updates during, we executed and finalized strategic partnership agreements with the australian federal government, the government of canada and the united kingdom government, respectively, to establish a state-of-the-art mrna vaccine manufacturing facility in each of these countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>each facility, when constructed, is expected to provide people in the country with access to a domestically manufactured portfolio of mrna vaccines against respiratory viruses, including sars-cov-, seasonal influenza, rsv, and other potential respiratory viruses, pending licensure.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as part of these strategic collaborations, we expect to support expanded research and development programs in each of these countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have committed to returning capital to our shareholders via share repurchase programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>during, we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for billion.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in december, we purchased a priority review voucher (prv), which allows us to apply for expedited fda review of a licensing application for one of our drug candidates.<br>

</p><p style='color: red;'>for the years ended december,, and, we recognized billion, billion, and million, respectively, of product sales from sales of our covid vaccines.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, we had deferred revenue of billion associated with customer deposits received or billable under supply agreements of which we expect billion of our covid vaccines to be delivered in.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we believe that the sars-cov- virus is likely evolving to an endemic phase and as a result, we expect that covid vaccine market will likely shift to an endemic seasonal market and our product sales will decline in compared to.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>other than product sales, our revenue in, and was derived from government-sponsored and private organizations including barda, darpa and the bill & melinda gates foundation and from strategic alliances with astrazeneca, merck and vertex to discover, develop, and commercialize potential mrna medicines.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in the third quarter of, astrazeneca elected to terminate our collaborations, effective on november, as a result of the termination, we recognized the remaining deferred revenue of million as collaboration revenue during the third quarter of.<br>

</p><p style='color: red;'>in the fourth quarter of, in accordance with the pcv/sav agreement, we granted a worldwide license to merck for future development and commercialization, upon receipt of the participation payment of million from merck, and recognized collaboration revenue of million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, the remaining available funding, net of revenue earned was million under the barda contract.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>to the extent that existing or potential future products generate revenue, our revenue may vary due to many uncertainties in future product demand, the development of our mrna medicines and other factors.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>cost of sales cost of sales includes raw materials, personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing our commercial products.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs include production materials, production costs at our manufacturing facilities, third-party manufacturing costs, and final formulation and packaging costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>cost of sales also includes shipping costs, indirect overhead costs associated with our product sales during the period, third-party royalties on net sales of our products, and charges for inventory valuation and losses on firm purchase commitments.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>research and development expenses the nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following: cost to develop our platform; discovery efforts leading to development candidates; preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical development costs for our programs; cost to develop our manufacturing technology and infrastructure; and digital infrastructure costs related to our drug discovery efforts and clinical trials.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the costs above comprise the following categories: personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, investigative sites, contract research organizations, or cros, that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and in-licensing arrangements; table of content expenses associated with developing manufacturing capabilities and acquiring materials for preclinical studies, clinical trials and pre-launch inventory, including both internal manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or cmos; expenses incurred for the procurement of materials, laboratory supplies, and non-capital equipment used in the research and development process; upfront fees and milestones paid to third-parties for licenses and technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use; and facilities, depreciation, and amortization, and other direct and allocated expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform, and for discovering and developing programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects, indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are generally not recorded or maintained on a program- or modality-specific basis.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>includes a total of development candidates at december, development candidates at december, and development candidates at december, program-specific expenses are reflected as of the beginning of the period in which the program was internally advanced to development or removed if development was ceased.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>a “modality” refers to a group of programs with common product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing processes.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the program-specific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs, which consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, central laboratories, investigative sites, and cros in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials, cmos, and allocated manufacturing costs of pre-launch inventory, mrna supply and consumables.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>costs to acquire and manufacture pre-launch inventory, mrna supply for preclinical studies and clinical trials are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred, and subsequently allocated to program-specific manufacturing costs after completion of the program-specific production.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the timing of allocating manufacturing costs to the specific program varies depending on the program development and production schedule.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we generally do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, costs associated with our general platform research, technical development, and other shared costs on a program-specific basis.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs were therefore excluded from the summary of program- specific expenses by modality.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>discovery program expenses are costs associated with research activities for our programs in the preclinical discovery stage, and primarily consist of external costs for cros and lab services, and allocated manufacturing cost of preclinical mrna supply and consumables.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>platform research expenses are mainly costs to develop technical advances in mrna science, delivery science, and manufacturing process design.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs include personnel-related costs, computer equipment, facilities, preclinical mrna supply and consumables, and other administrative costs to support our platform research.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>technology development and unallocated manufacturing expenses are primarily related to non-program-specific manufacturing process development and manufacturing costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>shared discovery and development expenses are research and development costs such as personnel-related costs and other costs, which are not otherwise included in development programs, discovery programs, platform research, technical development, certain collaborative and licensing arrangements, and unallocated manufacturing expenses, stock-based compensation, and other expenses.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including development of our platform, mrna technologies, and manufacturing technologies.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we expense research and development costs as incurred and cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing, and estimated costs required to complete the development of the development candidates and investigational medicines we are currently developing or may develop in the future.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>changes in expectations or outcomes of any of the known or unknown risks and uncertainties may materially impact our expected research and development expenditures.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development, such as our rsv vaccine, seasonal flu vaccine, cmv vaccine and our covid vaccines, generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as our investigational medicines progress through the development phases and as we identify and develop additional programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our investigational medicines, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time due to the early stage of development of many of our investigational medicines.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>moreover, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>selling, general and administrative expenses we started to incur sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of to prepare for commercial operations in connection with the sale of our covid vaccines, and these expenses increased throughout the course of and.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for executives, finance, legal, human resources, business development and other administrative and operational functions, professional fees, accounting and legal services, information technology and facility-related costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property, or ip.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual program.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand the number of programs in development and prepare for the establishment of commercial activities both within and outside the united states.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we have already incurred additional expenses related to building out a regulatory, sales and marketing team to support the sale, marketing and distribution of our covid vaccines and the expansion of our footprint across the globe, with active subsidiaries in more than countries.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>if we obtain regulatory approval for additional investigational medicines, and do not enter into one or more third-party commercialization collaboration and manufacturing arrangements, we will incur significant additional expenses related to building out these functions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we have a broad ip portfolio covering our development and commercialization of mrna vaccine and therapeutic programs, including those related to mrna design, formulation, and manufacturing platform technologies.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we also hold trademarks and trademark applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>costs to secure and defend our ip are expensed as incurred, and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>interest income interest income consists of interest generated from our investments in cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, and high-quality fixed income securities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>other expense, net other expense, net consists of interest expense, gains (losses) from the sale of investments in marketable securities, gains (losses) related to changes in fair value of investments in equity securities, and other income and expense unrelated to our core operations.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>interest expense is primarily derived from our finance leases related to our moderna technology center and certain contract manufacturing service agreements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>income taxes we account for income taxes based on an asset and liability approach.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in making this determination, we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>changes in these estimates may result in significant increases or decreases to our tax provision in a period in which such estimates are changed, which in turn would affect net income or loss.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, we maintained a valuation allowance against a portion of the state deferred tax assets based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the nature of uncertain tax positions is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change, which may be substantial.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions in the period when these changes are determined.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position, and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the related tax position.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>recently issued accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.<br>

</p><p style='color: green;'>we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>contractual obligations and commitments the amounts in the table include a total payment of million associated with our mtc leases for the optional lease extension periods.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>for accounting purposes, a lease term is the non-cancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>table of content we entered into a lease agreement in for approximately, square feet in cambridge, massachusetts (moderna science center) and are currently undergoing an approximately two-year building project.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>following the building project, the lease term is years, subject to our right to extend the lease for up to two additional seven-year terms.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>the rent will commence on the commencement date defined in the lease agreement that is currently estimated to be the fourth quarter of.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the amounts represent non-cancelable fixed payment obligations related to purchases of raw materials, contract manufacturing services, clinical services and other goods or services in the normal course of business.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, million of the purchase commitments related to raw materials was recorded as an accrued liability for loss on future firm purchase commitments.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we have agreements with certain vendors for various services, including services related to clinical operations, and support and contract manufacturing, which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors, mainly to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination, and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>at december, we had cancelable open purchase orders of billion in total under such agreements for our clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay at december, assuming we would not cancel these agreements.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the cancelable open purchase order amounts of billion.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>in addition to the above obligations, we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that were material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.<br>

</p><p style='color: green;'>quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december, and, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable securities of billion and billion, respectively.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our investment portfolio comprises money market funds and marketable debt securities (including us treasury securities, debt securities of us government agencies and corporate entities, and commercial paper), which are classified as available-for-sale securities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity, and our investment policy defines allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to minimize risk exposure.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>due to the short-term maturities and low risk profiles of our investments, we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by one percentage point from levels at december, the net fair value of our marketable securities would decrease by approximately million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>foreign currency risk our revenue generating activities and operations have been primarily denominated in us dollars.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our significant foreign currency revenue exposure for the year ended december, was the equivalent of billion in euros and billion in japanese yen.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>to help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented cash flow hedging and balance sheet hedging programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>cash flow hedging activities we hedge foreign currency product sales denominated in euros and japanese yen, including the use of foreign exchange forward contracts or purchased options.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we hedge our cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>our foreign exchange contracts as of december, carried at fair value, had maturities of up to one month.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>table of content balance sheet hedging activities we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>these contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.<br>
</p><p style='color: red;'>as of december, our outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives, carried at fair value, had maturities of less than one month.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted revenue and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material, a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, a hypothetical adverse movement of percent in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollars across all maturities would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of approximately million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>as of december, a hypothetical adverse movement of percent in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollars across all maturities would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of approximately million.<br>
</p><p style='color: green;'>we expect that any increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the underlying exposures being hedged.<br>
