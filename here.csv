not say that it's a linear sort of what we see this year is what's going to happen in the future. I think there are a
couple of things that could change year-over-year. It could be severity of disease. So depending on the variant
that's circulating and the hospitalizations and the rate of people getting sick could certainly change that equation.

I think the other piece that's different this year versus in future years is the ACIP recommendation, and the
approval just happened yesterday. Whereas in future years, this will become more sort of common practice as
part of universal recommendations. And then, I think the third piece is hopefully starting next year, we'll be more in
line and in sync with the flu launch timing, so that when flu vaccines are available, COVID vaccines will also be
available, right, to capture those patients that are getting in â€“ going in early.

So I think it's a good data point, but I would believe that over time, the actual volume could increase, as there's
greater acceptance, there is greater â€“ it's also the first commercial year for the US. So there's more experience,
more acceptance, more understanding, I think, that volume or that market could grow.",1.8433179723502304,0.4608294930875576
9,9,Jacqueline Miller,"Senior Vice President-Development, Infectious Diseases and Research & Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"So I think as we reported earlier, right, one of the key things in any regulatory submission process is successfully
meeting your endpoints that you pre-specified and P302 was an incredibly successful study for us in terms of
learning. It was not as successful for us in terms of meeting that criterion. We actually did have a positive point
estimate on the overall vaccine efficacy. And you pointed out earlier that really was on the basis of a strong
efficacy of the A strains, and we observe that from an immunogenicity perspective in the P301. Where we fell a bit
short was on meeting the lower bound.

Any time you don't have enough cases you have wider confidence intervals. And the other thing we observed was
that our B efficacy wasn't what we want it to be in the product that we're going to put forward. And so I would say
the other piece of that was deciding to really invest in improving and developing the best possible flu product that
we can bring forward. And so that really is why we did the additional study and why we're going to go with the
accelerated approval. And I'm sure we'll have the opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of this vaccine in
the real world kind of moving forward.",4.30622009569378,0.4784688995215311
38,38,Kyle Holen,"Senior Vice President, Head of Development, Therapeutics and Oncology, Research and Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Yeah. Thank you for that question. So there's a lot of opportunity in rare disease to go quickly with much smaller
trials. This has been shown through precedent with multiple other agents that are in that space. And so I think the
opportunity we have for MMA is that we have a biomarker that we can use to assess the impact of the drug. And I
think if we can show that that biomarker has a correlation to clinical endpoints, I think it might be reasonable to
consider that as an accelerated approval, as a surrogate for accelerated approval.

We're struggling a little bit more with PA because we haven't found a relevant biomarker that can really assess
whether or not there's a clinical impact. And so I think for PA, we're going to focus mostly on the clinical impact of
that program, which takes a little bit longer for us to read out. We see effects on the biomarker for MMA within
weeks of dosing, whereas with PA, it takes a bit longer to capture all that MDEs. So, that's our current strategy.
But for PKU, I think it will follow a similar path of MMA, where we have a relevant biomarker and there's already a
drug that has been approved based on a biomarker in an accelerated fashion, and so I think we can follow that
same path.",0.9615384615384616,0.4807692307692308
4,4,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"I'll take a first crack at the flu stuff and then ask Jackie to correct me where I get it wrong. But as a general point,
so we're following established regulatory guidance, what we're doing, we've had conversations as we've run
through these Phase 3 studies. But in any study, when you get to an end of a Phase 3 and you've met your end
points, the appropriate next step is to, in the US that have a pre-BLA meeting and other jurisdictions is down, we
say, here's the data, now can we talk about what the package looks like? And that's ultimately the process that
we're engaging in right now. Those are pretty quick conversations that will be going on through the fall and in the
background, you can be rest assure that we're doing the work to prepare everything to file. But until we have that
feedback of how they want to see the package come together, how much follow-up they want to see, even in the
P303 study, we won't have the answer on filing timelines. Rest assured, we're using every minute we can, it get
happen, happens fast as possible. But we have to have those conversations.",1.0204081632653061,0.5102040816326531
47,47,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Yeah. I think R&D is pretty flexible. And we make investment decisions around these programs to try and drive
towards the product launches. The overwhelming majority of the budget is dedicated to clinical trials and clinical
expense, and the overwhelming majority of that is in the late stage. And as you look at the spend drivers, you can
see that that drives more towards our respiratory studies right now. That makes sense. Those are very large, as
Kyle was joking a moment ago. As they rotate down, they'll change. But those studies tend to run the year. All
right. So one way to think of that is that that's probably the gate in which we have really substantial flexibility. But
more importantly, we kind of look at those commitments to start a Phase 3 study to get a product launch as
franchise, a value creation event. Actually, it generates financing opportunities in the years ahead. So as we
make those investments and as we see those successes, we actually think it allows us to make more investments
going forward. But we have a high degree of flexibility, certainly over five years and even a year or two.",1.06951871657754,0.53475935828877
18,18,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"No, I â€“ because I want to say it was globally run, it was randomized. We're seeing this in multiple countries, and
we're following it over time. The short version of it is we've got to get this. We believe this medicine will get to
patients quickly if we do a bunch of things, right? We're focused on getting this done.

You asked then how do we expand in oncology? Again, thank you for that question. Yeah, we're still â€“ so
specifically we've got programs like our intratumoral programs. You mentioned the Triplet, which we've seen
some interesting early data and we're still waiting for that confirmatory proof-of-concept study that absolutely
clear, well-powered signal that like, oh, that's doing something and we have to advance quickly there. So I think in
the other modalities that we have in clinical development right now, we have not yet seen that. Checkpoint is kind
of in between. We know our vaccines generate T cell responses. We have a biology question about those targets
and whether we can demonstrate a benefit in those tumors. And so we're running that study.

And then as you look at the other programs that I mentioned, what we're doing with Carisma in cell therapy, what
we're doing with the T cell and CAR-T booster vaccines and even what we're doing with  (03:07:48),
I think they're all categories that are somewhere in between those two, right? So, places where we're still looking
for proof-of-concept, trying to understand can the platform do a lot there? And what we're doing is partnering in
the biology or in the cases of checkpoint vaccine, advancing ourselves to try on our own and see whether or not
as a proof-of-concept.

And so when we hit one of those, well, those are all in the same therapeutic area, kind of view them all as related,
very adjacent modalities. And if we hit one of those, then of course, we'll be doing a lot more, whether it's in cell
therapy, in vivo cell therapy, supporting CAR-Ts or",0.5865102639296188,0.5865102639296188
24,24,Jacqueline Miller,"Senior Vice President-Development, Infectious Diseases and Research & Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Yeah. Well, so the reason why we've been investing so much in developing the monovalent vaccines is really
twofold. One is, while combos will be great, not every country actually wants to implement combos, and some
physicians like the flexibility or patients like the flexibility of getting one at one time. But what that also allows us to
do is really have an anchor to which we can bridge back. We've actually capitalized on this with COVID, the
immunobridging strategy. So, we've managed to expand the age indication by doing some immunobridging work.
And we've also managed to license the bivalents and now the monovalent for this fall, again really based on
immunobridging.

So it's really a similar kind of strategy where we will enroll certain number of individuals, we will ensure that we
have a safety database that the agency considers to be sufficient. And then we also will compare immune
responses to those monovalent vaccines that we now will know can be efficacious and that really is the rationale
on which that platform is based. So, what it means is we're able to be a bit more efficient in our development in
the sense that the investments we're making now in those monovalent programs actually pay dividends when we
then try to develop multiple combos, because you can imagine those efficacy trials would very rapidly expand if
we were going to do that in every [ph] instance (03:11:21).

In some ways, that's also why we waited for that flu/COVID combo to move forward. We needed to know [ph] we
nailed it, (03:11:28) right, because if you got there and you didn't have, the [ph] monos tilt up. (03:11:33) You
might be wasting some efforts.",1.083032490974729,0.7220216606498195
34,34,Jacqueline Miller,"Senior Vice President-Development, Infectious Diseases and Research & Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Yeah. That's a great question. And I'm going to answer twofold. So there's one from like a scientific proof-of-
concept and then there's also a manufacturing piece to the ultimate launch of the product.

So from a clinical perspective, I think launching the combos, it wasn't actually obvious that you could put more
than one antigen in the vaccine and actually get the immune response to both. So immune interference is
something that all vaccinologists have to think through. And our ability to do that and generate specific responses
with the bivalent not only to the Wuhan that people had been primed and boosted to for years before, but then
also to the BA.4-5. So being able to turn that immune response on when there was such an immunodominant
favoritism towards the Wuhan I think was incredibly encouraging to us.

And then, from the manufacturing piece, our ability to launch last year the vaccine within 90 days from the
recommendation of FDA, go with Omicron BA.4-5 to the bivalent, it's double a complexity of launching a
monovalent. And I think that also gives us confidence that we're going to be able to develop the procedures we
need in order to launch a COVID flu â€“ hopefully one day a COVID flu RSV. And it actually also speaks to the
flexibility of the platform. So part of the reason why we are looking at so many different combos in Phase 1, there
may be in some situations or for some patients, one combo that's better than another. One of the benefits of the
platform is being able to pivot from making one thing to being able to make a different thing for another customer.
And that's not something that's necessarily as feasible with other technologies.",3.3210332103321036,0.7380073800738007
37,37,Jacqueline Miller,"Senior Vice President-Development, Infectious Diseases and Research & Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"And, I guess, Arpa, the only thing I would add is looking to the future, there are really two advantages of mRNA.
One is I think we have hundreds of millions of children that have received an mRNA respiratory vaccine, which is
not necessarily true for other kinds of platforms, which is why we're already enrolling in a study of children as
young as 5 months of age to look at actually addressing an even bigger problem, frankly, in RSV disease.

The second reason is again going back to the combos. When you have multiple vaccines that are on the same
platform, that formulation becomes so much easier than if you're having to figure out ways to combine different
vaccines on different platforms. And so we're fairly confident that that's going to help us accelerate bringing the
combo vaccines to market.",2.2222222222222223,0.7407407407407408
8,8,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"(02:58:22) I'll start us out. The first on P303 because we met that the regulatory guidance on
 (02:58:30) for accelerated approval that's the phase 3 that can right now go forward and that's the
basis of our current thinking and strategy for engaging with regulators. P302 as you are, as you know, as we said
today, we didn't accrue enough cases. We would â€“ we've said previously we need probably something like 400
and we didn't get there in that season. The next step in that study logically would enroll a second season. That
would take longer, with P303 in our hands right now , it feels like the accelerate approval path on that is the faster
path to market. But, Jackie, you want to speak to the questions of what we might do alternatively or we'll get you
to follow-up and build on the success of P303.",0.7462686567164178,0.7462686567164178
1,1,Arpa Garay,"Chief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.",A,"So I can take the first question on combo pricing. On the way obviously, we're still working through the pricing.
The way we're thinking about it is the value that the combination provides back to the health care system. So it
would not just be priced at flu or at COVID, but really the totality of the COVID and the flu benefit. So it will vary by
market. It will also be taking into consideration the total cost because in some cases based on administration fees
and office visits, the total cost of getting two injections is actually significantly higher than getting one. So we'll be
looking at total and we'll be looking at price for value versus tagging it to a monotherapy.",0.8130081300813009,0.8130081300813009
35,35,Arpa Garay,"Chief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Sure. So in terms of differentiation, I'd say â€“ and Jackie can add a little bit more on the clinical side. We have
shown consistent high effectiveness data across multiple subgroups, which is a differentiator versus the
competition. The second piece, as I mentioned, we are the only mRNA vaccine for RSV and we have a very well-
established tolerability and safety profile based on all of our experience with COVID in the real-world setting.

As Jackie mentioned, we also have not seen any cases of GBS or other severe neurological safety side effects.
And then last but not least, just from an implementation perspective, we will be the only company with a ready-to-
use prefilled syringe. On both GSK and Pfizer, we'll have to be reconstituted. There are multiple steps involved.
And that's where from a customer perspective, we're hearing a preference for ready-to-use in terms of time saving
and also in terms of reducing medical errors. It's across the three.

In terms of the market, with the shared clinical decision making, I think it was on â€“ there was a little bit of
uncertainty. I think you heard from all the companies around what would that uptake look like. What we are
hearing in the early days of the launch is actually that the demand has been much stronger than anticipated. So
we're hearing this directly from retail pharmacies that the uptake is very strong. Over the next couple of weeks,
we'll get more data on what does that curve look like. But it's better than expected.",1.2244897959183674,0.8163265306122449
46,46,James M. Mock,"Chief Financial Officer, Moderna, Inc.",A,"SG&A. I'll let Stephen talk about  (03:28:01). So we believe we can act pretty quickly in both
categories. Number one, we use a lot of outside services and partners. It's easier to shut that down. That's a
substantial portion and it's not a long-term contract.

On the cost of goods sold side, as I mentioned, it'll take a little bit of time. And I think extra volume, the
combinations, that'll help us achieve our overall 75% to 80% gross margin. But you'll see a marked step from
2023 to 2024 in terms of our cost of goods sold percent. So we might not get the entire way there, but we're

$25 billion. Should it not be â€“ should the strength of this core business not achieve what we think is probably





lower than $25 billion? Should it be higher? We actually might invest a little bit more than $25 billion. So, we
definitely look at those plans. And right now we think we feel comfortable that â€“ that's our best guess in terms of

2,2,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"And thanks for the research question. It's scary questions. And Look, I'll be honest. We are a platform company.
So we start with the question what does the platform do? What do we know it's capable of doing biologically? And
then we go out and in some cases find other people who have knowledge about the target biology. So if you look
at the deals that I was talking about before, we're doing T cell vaccines and CAR T-cell vaccines with the same
platform technology that we were talking about in infectious diseases with a couple of companies 
(02:53:05) we think have really terrific cell therapies. So pretty straightforward now, one plus one could actually be
three there. And that's place where we didn't have to work out that Claudin 18.2 biology or the TCRT cell therapy
of  (02:53:19). We actually just look at somebody who is doing as I said, our platform combine with
that could do something really special to the durability of solid tumors sponsors. I'd say this same is true with
Carisma, right. Carisma is going to be an example of company that's work down myeloid cell therapy or in the
clinic with it kind of hard complicated thing to do cell therapy.

But we already know based on what we are doing with the rare disease that we can actually chronically dose
safely even at high level doses we can transact those cells if you want to we can make proteins on them and in
them. And so for us, it's another one of the technologies as we don't need to go become Carisma like experts on
CarMax. We need to go apply the technology that brings them to another level. So that's where we start in many
of our cases. Now, there are examples where we will look at a biology and say, Gosh, nobody's solved that and
the technology can do it. And those are places where you'll see us build more discovery biology in a more
traditional way and getting deep on pathways and targets. But it'll be more the exception than the rule in our
approach. Kyle, I don't know if you want anything there.",0.0,1.1627906976744187

10,10,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"The other part of your question just to hit is you mentioned maybe even being superior in terms of efficacy. Look,
we're â€“ scientifically, we're excited with that. We see really high GMRs here, even in our smaller studies we're





excluding one. So there's a reason for some optimism that those higher titers will translate. We have to go prove
that though. So for now, we're just pursuing the accelerated approval path for the P303 study.",2.666666666666667,1.3333333333333335

oncology is a very complicated field and there's a lot of target discovery happening all over the globe. And so if we
can leverage that information and use our technology to help create a better way to target that specific protein,
then we'll do it. And I think that's the best path forward.",2.8169014084507045,1.4084507042253522
12,12,Kyle Holen,"Senior Vice President, Head of Development, Therapeutics and Oncology, Research and Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Sure. So, let me follow up on our question about INT and regulators. So we need to follow our statistical analysis
plan for our randomized Phase 2 trial. So we will be following that plan, waiting for our events, making sure that
we're doing our analyses as written by our protocol and by our statistical analysis plan. And when we have those
data, we hope to share them not only with regulators, but hopefully at upcoming scientific congresses.

The discussions around accelerated approval are complicated. Of course, there's a lot of things besides just data
that I think regulators want to see. They want to make sure that you have a commitment to moving forward with
large randomized Phase 3 trials. They want to make sure that you have robust safety data. And so all of these
things are things that we're trying to pull together to make sure that we've got the best package possible. But in
terms of the criteria that you're asking about, like what are the exact criteria that regulators want to see, I can't
answer that question because those are discussions that we continue to have with our regulators.",0.5263157894736842,1.5789473684210527
30,30,Jacqueline Miller,"Senior Vice President-Development, Infectious Diseases and Research & Development, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Okay. And then, for CMV, so we just finished enrollment. But the way that these trials actually read out is not
based on enrollment or length of time in study, but how the cases accrue. So CMV accrues a bit differently than
respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses obviously have this huge peak in the winter, CMV is a little bit more
sustained year round, but I think harder to predict.

It's also a six-month vaccination schedule. So you get three doses over six months. So we believe we may have a
readout as early as at the end of next year. We are starting to capture cases. So we're 22 cases there towards the
interim analysis at 81 cases. So it could be shorter, it could be longer depending on how those cases accrue.

But why you should care about it is an easier question for me to answer. So beyond the fact that I think this is
something that once people appreciate the value in preventing birth defects, so it's not just in the overall cost. I
think immediately after birth, it's the lifelong preservation of contribution to society that really matters. There are
other things in CMV that we may be able to investigate as well. So we have a study ongoing right now in
hematopoietic stem cell transplant CMV. Viremia is an enormous problem actually in transplant patients, both
solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell.

And if we can figure out and crack the code of how to prevent viremia in those individuals, well, that not only is a
market in itself, but it also opens up the possibility to learn and really work through these other therapeutic
vaccines like EBV and like HSV. So I am super excited about CMV. I can't wait to see what those data look like
once they are approved.",1.048951048951049,1.7482517482517483
21,21,Stephen Hoge,"President, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Yeah. Hi, Gena. I'm going to disappoint you because we've had â€“ literally had competitors come up to us
conferences and say, we can't wait for you to tell us how to solve that problem. And so we are not right now
talking about what we've done in just the last 6, 12 months. But as Raffael said, we're really proud of the platform
we built and the ability it allows us to make those quickly changes. What really matters is the proof is in the
pudding, where we were able to demonstrate just looking at B antigens as we think potentially best in class over
time, we'll see. And we're really excited by those titers. It shows we've",2.6548672566371683,1.7699115044247788
28,28,Arpa Garay,"Chief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.",A,"Okay. So I'll start with the pricing question. The list price is around the $129, $130 that we publicly announced. As
we get from listing that, obviously, it depends on the customer, it depends on the segment. So we don't have an
average net price that we're going to share. Typically, from a vaccines perspective, you're giving discounts for
wholesalers, distributors, GPOs, and then actual customer contracting, right? We do have separate pricing that is
generally public, which I believe is now public for also the federal systems, CDC, VA and DOD.

Should I answer your pricing question? There was a second part.",0.0,2.127659574468085
