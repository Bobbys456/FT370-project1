Thank you. Well, let's start with the topic du jour; not one but two strikes. Can you give us your views of how this
affects your business on a practical basis? How far out does your original content take you? And how much of the
content spend do you think gets pushed from this year into next year?

Thanks, Jessica. Good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Let me start by making something absolutely clear.
This strike is not an outcome that we wanted. We make deals all the time. We're constantly at the table
negotiating with writers, with directors, with actors, with producers, with everyone across the industry, and we very
much hoped to reach an agreement by now.

So, I also wanted to say, if I may, on a personal level, I was raised in a union household. My dad was a member
of IBEW Local 640. He was a union electrician. And I remember his local because that union was very much a
part of our lives when I was growing up. And I also remember on more than one occasion my dad being out on
strike. And I remember that because it takes an enormous toll on your family financially and emotionally.

So you should know that nobody here, nobody within the AMPTP, and I'm sure nobody at SAG or nobody at the
WGA took any of this lightly. But we've got a lot of work to do. There are a handful of complicated issues. We're
super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible, one that's equitable, and one that enables the
industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.

In terms of the content, how much original content do you have? Do you run out like at a certain point in time, you
probably will.

Well, look, we put some of our upcoming content in the letter. We said in the last call we produce heavily across
all kinds of content, TV, film, unscripted, scripted, local domestic, English, non-English, all those things. And
they're all true. But it's besides the point. The real point is we need to get this strike to a conclusion so that we can
all move forward.

Absolutely. So let's move on to password sharing, which is something everyone on the call wants to hear about.
Could you give us kind of like state of the union? What progress have you made to-date? And when will the rollout
be complete?

Yeah, Jessica. So we've worked really hard iteratively over many months and really even over a year-and-a-half
to find an approach that we thought was a good product experience for most consumers, that gave them the
information that they needed to make clear decisions that included features that they wanted. So think about
transferring [ph] a (00:03:13) profile and your viewing history to a new account, easy ways to manage your
devices and account access, being able to purchase that extra membership for a loved one.

So we've done a good job at building those features, we think, but also in a way that balances those user
considerations with making sure that Netflix was able to get reasonably paid when we delivered entertainment to
someone. So then, of course, we could invest that into making the service better for everyone.

As of today, we've now launched that experience in almost all the countries that we operate in, and we're seeing
that it's working. We're positive in terms of both revenue and subscribers relative to prelaunch in all of our regions.
But I also think it's important to note that the business impacts of that product experience will roll in over several
quarters.

So, it's not an overnight kind of thing, because in part the interventions are applied gradually and in part because
some borrowers won't immediately sign up for their own account, but will do so next month or three months or six
months or maybe even longer down the line as we launch a title that they're particularly interested in.

So we're live in the vast majority of countries, over 90% of countries by revenue, and we're going to continue to
iterate and execute that model.

Is there a way to think about segments of borrowers who have yet to convert? It feels like there's another wave
coming or maybe several waves, maybe college students who are home for the summer and will go back in
August or September. I don't know that mobile devices have been shut off yet. Anecdotally, many people who are
not on mobile devices have said they haven't been cut off yet. So can you help us think through that?

Yeah. So there's components of it that are essentially what you describe, where whether it's because there's
behaviors or because how we've organized the product experience, how those roll out, they'll happen over time.
And so we'll see those interventions broaden to more of those cohorts over a period of time. So that's one sort of
component of phasing it out.

The other component is that we see differential engagement across that borrower population. So there are some
borrowers who are using the service every day, and those folks are very likely to transfer to their own account
very soon. And then some folks are less engaged, and it's going to take us a little bit longer to convince them to
move over with great stories, great TV shows and films.

So, both of those effects essentially are what distribute the business impact from this product experience. So
that's why I would think about it as we're seeing effects right now, but we'll also see those effects over the next
many quarters.

Can you provide any color on the results? Like, what percent have converted to paying and on what plan? Like,
[indiscernible] (00:06:08) members versus subscribers? Your subscriber numbers were great this quarter, but
they were also add-ons to households. So can you help us think through? And did people change plans?

Yeah. I would say, generally, what we see is these are well qualified members. So, in other words, they are
choosing plans and are engaging at rates, have retention characteristics that generally look like higher tenure
members. That's good because they're well qualified. That retention is quite good in essence.

So that's a broad way to think about what those borrower cohorts are. And that's consistent also with the fact that
we'll convert essentially those most engaged, most well qualified borrowers first. That's a general way to think
about it. And then, beyond that, I won't comment on more specific numbers.

Well, maybe if you can help us think through like, in UCAN, how much of the ARM growth is a function of add-on
members to existing accounts versus new subs signing up to higher-priced plans. And it sounds like from your
letter that ARM will accelerate in second half as you get further along in password sharings. Is that correct?

Chief Financial Officer, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                       A
Yeah. Maybe just broadly thinking about our kind of revenue in Q2 and going forward, Jessica, key is that we
delivered revenue in line in Q2 with our expectations, and we're on track to accelerate that revenue in Q3 and
further accelerate in Q4. And that's really our primary objective around revenue acceleration, and we're set to
deliver on it.

But if we step back on thinking about our revenue growth in components overall or within a given region, it's
driven by a combination of pricing, volume and new revenue streams like ads. So, if we think about each one of
those, so we're now more than a year out from any price adjustments in our big revenue countries. We largely
paused them during paid sharing rollout, and so that's to be expected.

For ads, that new revenue stream, we've expected a gradual revenue build, and so that's not expected to be a big
contributor this year. So continues to be on target. So most of our revenue growth this year is from growth in
volume through new paid memberships, and that's largely driven by our paid sharing rollout. It is our primary
revenue accelerator in the year, and we expect that impact, as Greg said, to build over several quarters.

So that's what we're seeing in each of our regions and in UCAN. So, UCAN is a little bit more benefit from ads,
per se, because it's a bigger advertising market, but still very small overall because it's still nascent to the
business.

But there's another surprise that you had in the last couple of weeks, which seems like it could also be a very
positive driver to ARM, and that is that you dropped the basic plan in Canada several weeks ago, and you just
announced that in the US and UK. So I guess a couple of questions here.

Are there any plans for the rest of the world? And has it so far, from your experience in Canada, has it driven the
response that you hoped for? Is the response that more people go to the advertising tier? And then, I guess, one
other final part of this question is that it's an obvious positive for ARPU. It feels like the impact is like $5 or more
per month. When this is fully rolled out over three years or so – like, over what period of time do you think this will
have the most impact?

Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                         A
Sure. We think this is a continuation of what we've generally done for a long period of time, which is think about
how do we optimize the plan structure, the pricing, the features that we have, with really two goals in mind.

One goal is we want to give consumers access across a wide range of price points so that more people around
the world can enjoy the great stories that Bela's team is doing. That means the appropriate spread of prices and
the appropriate corresponding features including ads, no ads, video quality, number of simultaneous streams.
And we'll seek to actually add to that list of features over a period of time.

And the second big goal that we've got and think about this is optimizing long-term revenue, and that includes a
bunch of factors that you might expect. It's signup conversion. It's plan take rate, engagement, retention. And just
as we evolved from a single plan years ago and have adjusted our offering over time, this latest move reflects
what we think will best achieve those goals in the countries that we launched it in: US, UK, and Canada.

And I think it's also important to note that, from that perspective, accessibility and affordability, we think the entry
prices that we have right now in those countries, so $6.99 in the United States, £4.99 in the UK, and CAD 5.99 in
Canada, represent an amazing entertainment value. And those are attracting a healthy share of signups.

So, in terms of the specific effects that you're talking about, it's pretty much what you would expect, which is,
when we drop that basic tier, folks that would have signed up for that tier essentially sort into two tiers. They either
take the ads plan, which is that really low attractive entry level price, or they move into the standard plan. And so
we see that sorting.

In terms of what we would expect, we are rolling this out in an iterative fashion across countries, and that allows
us to understand the impacts and not be surprised. So I think things are generally going as we expect in that
regard.

So, one last question and then I'll move on to advertising. But, for your new members or new subs from the
password sharing, are there any noticeable differences in churn?

Well, I would say, as I mentioned before, the way to think about these, the way that we're seeing them in terms of
the members that are signing up, borrowers that are spinning off now, I would characterize them as well qualified.
They're folks that have watched Netflix for a long period of time, and they know how Netflix works. So they're
behaving in terms of retention characteristics, churn characteristics, like more higher tenure subscribers, which is
good. That means better retention.

And, Jessica, maybe just a number of the questions you were asking is kind of getting at a little bit of, I think you
mentioned ARPU and we call it ARM or average revenue per member, but what are we kind of seeing in the
numbers and how does that play out as you think about the move out of the basic ad-free tiers you mentioned in
Canada and a couple other countries as of today and also as we build our ads. So maybe if I can just, for a
second, talk that through because it can get a little complicated.

But if you think about the drivers for average revenue per member, starting with the revenue drivers that we spoke
about a moment ago, you can see our FX-neutral ARM, it was down 1% FX-neutral in Q2, and we expect similar
in Q3, flat to slightly down. That's mostly due to the limited price adjustments we mentioned over the past year in
our big revenue markets in advance of rolling out paid sharing.

There's also at play here some movement in plan and country mix shift over time. Most of our member growth
over the past year has been outside of UCAN, so in lower ARM countries. So that plays into the ARM trends. But,
importantly, over time and over the medium to longer term, we expect ARM will benefit from price adjustments.
We haven't changed our long-term pricing philosophy. And it will benefit from ads and the extra members that you
mentioned.

It's just that both of those are early. We're still only a small percentage of our members are on the ads tier even
with the moves we just mentioned. Nice growth in the ads tier, but still off a small base. And we're really early in
terms of paid sharing impacts, including extra member, for the reasons that Greg mentioned. That's going to build
up over multiple quarters. And as they do, we'll see all of that demonstrate itself in growth in ARM over time, we
would expect.

Moving on to advertising, could you give me some color on some of the innovative or nontraditional offerings that
you have? One of the things you talked about in the upfront was like offering advertisers the ability to go into the
top 10, which is it provides an incredible reach; that guaranteed reach really all the time. Could you just talk
through some of the ways because you're thinking in ways that are very different from traditional media.

Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                         A
Yeah. I think, stepping back, it's useful to start with, we've got a lot of work to grow this business, and the first
priority that we're focused on is scale. We know that reach is one of the predominant considerations or the
dominant considerations that advertisers have when they think about where to go to spend their dollars. We want
to be in that top list. We grew ads plan membership almost 100% quarter-to-quarter, so that's good growth. That's
a good trajectory, as Spence mentioned. We want to continue that. That's job number one.

Job number two is we got a really solid list of advertiser-facing features that are not in that innovation category,
that are really more following a well-trodden path. We're rolling those out. These are things like verification.
They're measurement. They're targeting. I'd actually include in that bucket building out our go-to-market and sales
capabilities in every country so that we can serve more advertisers and serve them more effectively. So there's a
bunch of very straightforward work these follow in this well-established path. We just need to do the work. We
know we can do it, so it's heads down and execute.

And then we get to a little bit what you're talking about, which is an opportunity over time to really think about our
offering both in terms of unique capabilities that we can deliver that blend TV with properties of digital advertising
and also work at the interface of the user experience and the ads experiencing. And that really leverages the core
capabilities that we've used for a long, long period of time of UX testing, iterative development, data-driven
personalization to establish over time a leadership position in defining what is the premium ads experience on
CTV.

You can see glimpses of that right now. You mentioned top 10. I think that that is a creative way to think about
how we give advertisers a different way to have essentially a guaranteed participation in the most popular shows,
most popular films at any given moment on Netflix. So that's exciting. But there's just tons of work ahead of us,
tons of opportunity, and we're really focused on continual improvement. And we're also confident that all the
fundamentals are there and that we can build over those several years a material ads business.

Has there been any change to advertising ARM since last quarter when you said advertising ARM was at least as
high as the standard tier, indicating that advertising only part of it was $8.50 or more?

I can take it if you want, Greg. It's no change. Our overall ads ARM continues to be higher than basic ad-free
globally, same as the statement on standard in terms of standard with ads, higher than standard ad-free in the
US.

And so, generally, we're pleased with our per member ad economics and continue to feel really good about the
opportunity to grow the ads plan, the ads offering. Good for members. Good for our business. But, as Greg said,
we've got a lot of work to do to get from here to where it can be, we believe over time, which is a material
additional incremental revenue and margin driver for the business.

Can you tell us about your initial up-front advertising performance? You seem to have everything advertisers are
looking for, but this is a really tepid overall advertising environment. So is there anything you can say about what
the reaction's been?

Yeah. Sure. First of all, it's great to be able to have an opportunity to meet with so many advertisers in a
concentrated period and hear what they need from us. And so that's helpful to synthesize what are our top
requirements and how can we better support those advertisers.

I think you're absolutely right that the general market is soft. We're seeing that across multiple different
companies. But we benefit right now from being relatively small. So there's scarcity around our inventory. So I
think we're able to manage that process effectively, and we're seeing good demand and good progress on the
upfronts within that sort of broader soft market. But our job really now is to add as quickly as we can advertiser
features that meet their needs so that we can make our offering more attractive as we scale that inventory up.

Well, I would say it's a gradual ramp. If you're looking for a specific number, we have tens of engineers working
on this at this point in time. They're delivering features on a consistent basis. Microsoft has even more than that
that are delivering features on a consistent basis. And we're working in collaboration essentially in a priority order
when we see back to that what are advertisers telling us they need. We're just sort of knocking these down one
after another.

Is there like a time period? Like, in order to achieve scale, is this like a three-year plan before you feel like you
really have all the tech capabilities in place?

Gregory K. Peters
Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                         A
Yeah. Both scale in terms of reach and the tech capabilities in terms of features aren't sort of a binary condition.
It's not like you don't have it one day and then you suddenly have it the next day. So I would say we're just
constantly iterating and walking up both of those hills.

So, scale, I'm pretty impressed with being able to get to 100% quarter-to-quarter growth. So that's a good
trajectory. Feel that puts us on a good place, and that will be better and better every year essentially. And then
the technical features, again, we've got a long list. And it's not as if one day we're magically done. But continue to
progress on what we're doing right now allows us to sort of move from building the basics into that sort of
innovative space that you mentioned before.

Spence, this one may be for you, but what's your vision for the advertising contribution? You've said in the past
that you like it to be 10% of revenue. But, given the decline of linear, are you rethinking this so that it would be a
higher percent?

Chief Financial Officer, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                       A
Well, I think we've got a long way to go from where we are today to even getting to 10%, Jessica, so we don't
want to get ahead of our skis, if you will. We've got a lot of blocking and tackling to do. We believe it can be a
meaningful part of our business.

So, when we say 10%, it's in part because we wouldn't spend all this effort, time and energy, resource allocation,
senior management focus of Greg and Ted and others if we didn't think it could be at least 10% of revenue. So I
would say that's something that is a bar we're shooting for, hoping to meet or beat over time.

And, as you say, there's a lot of branded TV ad dollars that we set our sights on over time because we think we're
a great ecosystem and environment to collect that demand, but we have to prove it out over time. So, not ready to
kind of increase our long-term projections from one we haven't even really come close to getting to yet, Jessica.
So give us a little time I guess is what I would ask.

Sure. But maybe to follow-up on what you just said, like, where do you think the pool of ad dollars will come from
over time? Given all the capabilities that Greg just talked about, why would it be limited to linear? Because you're
going to have such extraordinary capabilities. Shouldn't the pool be linear and digital?

Yes. And it should be, but I'll let Greg speak to it.

Gregory K. Peters
Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                         A
I think it's fair to say that, over a period of time, we anticipate pulling both linear and digital dollars. But where we
are today, we're much more targeted at that linear brand-focused TV advertising. That's a sweet spot that we can
speak to right now. We're definitely building capabilities and have an aspiration to build capabilities that over time
will allow us to expand that envelope.

But, again, prize number one, first, is to go after that brand advertising. There's a lot of dollars there. There's a lot
of dollars looking for great consumers to connect with, and we think we can provide that solution.

Jessica, it's really over time to be a better than TV model. And so it starts with that, but it's blending the two
together and capturing both brand and digital dollars over time.

any noticeable differences between the tiers?

Well, there's generally some differences across the tiers that you might expect. More qualified, more engagement
generally means, as a broad statement, higher tier participation. But we haven't seen a change over time, if that's
specifically what you're getting to. So we're seeing good engagement across all of our tiers, good engagements
across our ads plan as well.

Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Netflix, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                         A
Yeah. No. The thing to keep in mind is that, as streaming continues to grow, so 37% of TV time now in the US,
and then we continue to grow our share of streaming in that growing space, even though it's very, very
competitive, probably best evidence is for nearly every week of this year, we've had the number one show and the
number one film on streaming. So that creates an enormous amount of, to your point, Jessica, of possibilities, but
all dependent on building those capabilities. So, as we put those things together, it's an enormous opportunity as
eyeballs increasingly move to streaming.

And they – by the way, they're moving to streaming because this is where the consumer demand is running. This
isn't like we've invented something and we're dragging them in. Basically, the consumers are long away from this
notion of the linear grid dictating what they can watch and where they can watch it and how they can watch it. And
the demand is on us to deliver on streaming and high quality content that they love. And our ability to monetize it
both through pure subscription and through advertising, if they choose to do so, is really dependent on us having
the content that they're excited about day in and day out, week in and week out, and in every country in the world.

Yeah. I think that's exactly right. And just the foundation of our attractiveness to advertisers is ultimately our
reach, this high level engagement and amazing titles, TV shows and films, like Ted mentioned, in the top 10 that
they want to have their brands next to.

So let's move on to free cash flow. You had an extraordinary quarter this second quarter, and you talked about
the outlook for Q3. Could you just maybe address the underlying dynamics, talk a little bit about content spend
and other investments?

Yeah. Sure. I can take that one, Jessica. What you see in our cash flow forecast, we took it up for 2023 in terms
of our expectations. It's really driven by few things. One, just higher certainty in our forecast with the early success
of the paid sharing rollout. We also had some move in production timing, just the typical ins and outs of the
schedule and then, lastly, the impact of the strikes.

And so there's still a pretty wide range of outcomes for where we're going to ultimately land on cash flow this year
given the ongoing strikes, and that may also create some lumpiness actually between 2023 and 2024, so still with
substantial expected free cash flow in 2024, but some lumpiness between the years.

More broadly, we're past that most cash-intensive phase of building out our original programming strategy. So
we'll have some near-term lumpiness, but if we apply a multiyear lens, we expect a positive and growing free cash
flow trajectory in the years ahead. So that's generally what you're seeing. And of course, as part of that just
ongoing prudent expense management, still growing our expenses, but trying to grow slower than revenue in a
responsible way that helps us scale healthy.

What's the content spend outlook for the next few years? What is normal post the strikes, plural?

Well, what you've seen is and what we talked about when our revenue had slowed down in early 2022 is that we
would keep our cash content spend roughly flat. And that's what we've been doing from 2022 through with the
plan through 2024 with the lumpiness that we talked about, some of it because of the kind of coming out of the
throes of COVID, as we talked about in the last couple calls and now most recently because of the strikes.

But our hope and our expectation is we get back up to those levels, similar levels in 2024 as we were in 2022. So
we will grow next year is our hope and expectation, back to those levels. And we talked about it in the letter, too.
What that works out to is roughly about a 1.1 ratio in terms of our cash content spend relative to our content
expense. So that allows us to kind of scale in a healthy way while also kind of growing our cash flow over time.

And then, as we prove out revenue acceleration, which we expect to do, as we've guided to start in Q3 and then
further in Q4, we hope to start ticking up our cash spend on content again and doing it in a healthy way. We have
to prove that out obviously. But we've got a lot of great entertainment that we hope to provide to members all
around the world, as Ted said. So we think we've got a lot more we can spend into. Spend it in a big opportunity,
but we want to do it responsibly.

But with your content spend very measured, let's put it that way, and you're kind of maybe investing in ad tech
capabilities. But, beyond that, like it feel like there's tremendous leverage in your business model. So is there a
way to think about growth in free cash flow beyond 2024?

So, I would say, Jessica, the best way to think about it is, we expect to grow revenue and profits over time. As
Spence mentioned, we are past the most cash-intensive phase. So that content cash spend to content
amortization ratio that we've talked a lot about in the past, we think, is going to be roughly in the neighborhood of
1.1x in 2024 and probably somewhere around that area for the foreseeable future based on the current plans.

So I think that gives you the right sort of building blocks to be able to get a rough sense of it. I think what you
would see is that would lead to very healthy free cash flow generation for the foreseeable future.

So can we talk about uses of free cash flow and maybe possibly M&A? There are a lot of distressed assets in
media land, maybe the lowest multiples in memory that we've seen. What assets might be interesting to you?

We just said we've always looked at these things in terms of the opportunity for IP versus those assets, some of
those assets are stressed for a reason. And so we're mostly looking at – what we're looking – our M&A activity
would be mostly around IP that we can develop into great content for our members which is our real strength in
the business.

So I think we have traditionally been very strong builders over buyers, and that really hasn't fundamentally
changed. But if there are opportunities that give us access to pools of IP that we can develop into and against that
could be super interesting.

And just maybe moving a little bit away from that, but you've developed a library over 10-plus years at this point.
And it's pretty substantial, and you've got some really amazing global titles. Would you consider selling your
library content to others?

Look, we always have found that we offer this content to our members in an unbelievable value on Netflix as of
now. And then almost anywhere else we put it, there's either a cross-over and they otherwise have a Netflix
account or have a much smaller viewing base. So we think we're taking the right course in terms of offering the
content to our members and having it around even after its original run on Netflix.

So the syndication market, the home video markets that continue to exist today are kind of contracting in a way
that isn't too exciting to build up against versus this opportunity we have to please our members and thrill our
members with our content all the way back through the history of our content. And the opportunity, we've also
seen things like when Extraction 2 just did so well for us this past quarter, Extraction 1 was popped right back into
the top 10. We've seen that a lot with new seasons of shows like when Queen Charlotte hit into the top 10, here
comes Bridgerton 1 and 2. So it's a very fluid and dynamic offering in that way and even better the deeper and
richer that library becomes.

There seems to be a lot going on in sports. You supposedly outbid or reportedly outbid ESPN for NFL sports
documentary. So maybe if you can include in live sports that would be great.

Look, our position in live sports remains unchanged. We're super excited about the success of our sports adjacent
programming. We just had recently just launched a great one called Quarterbacks (sic) [Quarterback] with the
NFL. A few weeks ago we had the Tour de France, which did exactly what we saw with Drive to Survive, which is
introduce a brand new audience to a sport that's been around for a really long time and not very well understood.
And you do that through exceptional storytelling, not through the liveness of the game.

So, by doing that, we can now offer this wide variety of sports programming for sports fans that's in-season year-
round, and it really leans on our strengths which are storytelling. So we're really excited about that.

And you read some of the experimental stuff that we're going to be doing like this live golf match in November,
and we're excited about that because it serves as a promotional vehicle for our sports brands like Full Swing and
Drive to Survive. So we really think that we can have a really strong offering for sports fans on Netflix without
having to be part of the difficulty or the economic model of live sports licensing.
