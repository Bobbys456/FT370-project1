0,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.","Thank you, Martin. So just a Q3 recap, our last quarter was impacted by downtime for global factory upgrades,
that will help us reduce cost per vehicle, as well increased production. We remain focused on three main
objectives, which is the cost reductions of our products, investments in artificial intelligence and other growth
projects like Optimus, and continued free cash flow generation.





Regarding vehicle costs, our team was able to reduce the cost per vehicle further in Q3, despite headwinds from
factory idle cost and ramp-up of new factories, and we believe there's still meaningful room for improvement
there.

Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles have now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD Beta, Full Self-Driving
Beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000-GPU cluster of H100s, we think
probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's ever brought that much compute per unit time into
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with Full Self-Driving and vehicle
autonomy.

We're also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it's photon count in,
controls out, or really, you can think of it as just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out,
compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work. The vast majority
of human data input is optics from our eyes. And so, we are, like the car, photons in, controls out, with neural nets
â€“ just neural nets in the middle. It's very interesting to think about that.

We'll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the massive game changer. And I mean,
success in this regard in the long term, I think, has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the
world by far. If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly
useful, it's not clear what the limit is.

Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3. And as this
business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute
over $0.5 billion dollars to quarterly profit.

The Cybertruck, I know that people are excited about Cybertruck. I am, too. I've driven the car. It's an amazing
product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the
Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This is simply normal for â€“ when you've got a
product with a lot of new technology or any brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and
advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve
at scale. So I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever, in fact, I think it is
our best product ever, it is going to be â€“ require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow
positive at a price that people can afford.

Often, people do not understand what is truly hard. That is why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
People think it's the idea where you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon as [ph] they're designing
the (00:05:42) car is, it's not just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a
prototype. But the difficulty then for a prototype to volume production is like 10,000% harder to get volume
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash
flow. That is why there have not been new car start-ups that have been successful for 100 years, apart from
Tesla.

So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product, but financially, it will take, I don't know,
a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor. I wish there was some way for that to
be different, but that's my best guess. Demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million people who have reserved
the car, so it's not a demand issue, but we have to make it, and we need to make it a price that people can afford,
insanely difficult things.





In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow, and we continue
to target and expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year. The Tesla AI team is,
I think, one of the world's best, and I think it is actually by far the world's best when it comes to real-world AI. I'll
say that again, Tesla has the best real-world AI team on earth, period, and it's getting better.

And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you're making."
1,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.","Thank you very much, Elon, and our CFO, Vaibhav, have some opening remarks as well."
2,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.","Thanks, Martin. Our vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of
profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continued focus on operational
excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer
sentiment.

As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our
factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500. We saw sequential
decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.

On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot
production testing, combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo. We have and
will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to
grow in the near term.

However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself,
we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cash flows of approximately $2.3
billion. Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis, with energy business leading
the charge primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments. Our services and other businesses on a year-on-
year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet.

As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car
buying happens with one or other form of financing. And hence, we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for
the customer. And therefore as interest costs in the US have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the
price of our vehicles to keep the monthly costs [ph] intact (00:10:14). We've tried to offset such adjustments via
our focus on reducing costs. However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the US, whereby you can get a
standard range Model Y for as low as $399 a month.

In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we're focused on reducing costs,
maximize delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular AI and other next-
generation platform. We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term. Once again, I would like to thank
the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter."
