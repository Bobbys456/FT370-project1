Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Tim, maybe if we start with you, if we go
back to the December quarter and the production shutdowns around that time, I think the question a lot of us were
asking was how should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand. March quarter was
quite strong, 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so, as we sit here in May, how have you seen that customers
that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave, meaning are you seeing that they deferred
purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later in hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just
how should maybe we think about the cadence of that? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.

Yes. Hi, Erik. It's hard to quantify this. But we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March
quarter, as we did see the iPhone performance accelerate relative to the December quarter. The production levels
for the whole quarter were where we wanted them to be. So, supply was not an issue during Q2.

Okay, perfect. Thank you for that color. And Tim, maybe to follow up, it's been three or four quarters now that
you've mentioned emerging markets like India and others. And I imagine having just opened two new stores in the
country, it's clearly an important market for you. So, maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an
important market and others, how you think about monetization trends in the country, and specifically, what you
have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business?
And that's it for me. Thanks so much.

Yeah, sure. Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record and grew very strong double-digits
year-over-year. So, it was quite a good quarter for us. Taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market.
It's a major focus for us. I was just there, and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time,
we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the
Apple Store Online. And then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago, and they're
off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well
that we're partnering with, and we're very happy with how that's going.

Overall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there. There are a lot
of people coming into the middle-class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there.
On other emerging markets, we had a stellar quarter in emerging markets overall, as I had mentioned, with
records set in a number of different places, including Indonesia and Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, UAE, and then quarterly records in Brazil, India and Malaysia. And so, it was a great quarter for emerging
markets in general despite the headwinds of the currency that Luca mentioned. And so, we're putting efforts in a
number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics,
et cetera, a great opportunity for us in those markets.

Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the record
installed base across iPhone and across all devices. It's been, I think, double-digit growth over the last few years
across the active devices. I was just wondering, is that a good way to think about the installed base growth going
forward? And then, for the iPhone installed base specifically, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of
texture around how you think about the growth there whether regionally or by first smartphones versus switchers.
And then, I have a quick follow-up.

Yeah. If you look at the installed base of active devices now, overall, it's more than 2 billion. As you know, we
announced in January that we surpassed that. And this quarter, or Q2 rather, we set new records across each of
the geographic segments and each of the major product categories, and that's despite declines in current quarter
sales in particular in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us and it's a testament to the overall customer
satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so, we view this as a major asset for us. The
iPhone base is well over 1 billion active devices. We see this as – upgrade rates and these sorts of things may
change quarter to quarter depending upon macroeconomic. But if you back up and look at the installed base, we
feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing.

Great. Excellent. And then, it was also encouraging to see the number of devices per iPhone user continuing to
grow. I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity to continue to increase that number of Apple
devices per iPhone user, and if you have any color around how the monetization per user may differ from those,
for lack of a better word, super-users versus those that may not be as deep into the ecosystem. Thanks.

We try really hard to design our products in such a way that they work seamlessly together. And so, whether
that's the Watch or the Mac and – so that you can start working on one device and finish it on the other. And so,
there are a good deal of people out there that have multiple Apple devices, and I think this is a testament to the
customer satisfaction and loyalty that we've been able to get from the incredible design that our engineering
teams do on our products.

Thank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about AI? It's obviously the –
more than the topic of the day, it seems like the topic of the year. Just how do you think about it through your
products and services? I know you use it in different ways. But also if you can just give us any thoughts you have
on generative AI, and I don't know, where you see it going. Not sure what you want to say on it, but I'm really
curious to see your take. Thank you.

Yeah. Thanks for the question, Shannon. As you know, we don't comment on product roadmaps. I do think it's
very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there's a number of issues
that need to be sorted, as is being talked about in a number of different places. But the potential is certainly very
interesting. And we've obviously made enormous progress integrating AI and machine learning throughout our
ecosystem, and we weaved it into products and features for many years, as you probably know. You can see that
in things like fall detection and crash detection and ECG. These things are not only great features, they're saving
people's lives out there. And so, it's absolutely remarkable. And so, we are – we view AI as huge, and we'll
continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.

you have on what you've seen as you started to shift more and more outside of China, whether it's growth or it's
actual production? Thank you.

Our supply chain is truly global, and we're investing all over the world. We're investing in the US. We're investing
in a number of other countries as well. And so, we make products everywhere. We'll continue to invest
everywhere. And we'll continue to look for ways to optimize the supply chain based on what we learn each and
every day and week and so forth to ensure that we can deliver the best products and services for our customers.
If you sort of step back and look at how we performed over the last three years on the supply chain, despite this
parade of horribles, if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic kind of factors,
the supply chain has been incredibly resilient. And we feel good about what we are and what our plans are.

channel inventory levels as well for iPhones? And I have a follow-up.

Sure. It's hard to quantify, Wamsi. But we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter.
And obviously, we had to set the channel at the right levels, and we're very comfortable with the channel inventory
that we have on a forward basis. So, we do think there was some, but it's difficult to quantify it.

you mentioned buy now, pay later, a high-yield savings account. Where do you see the expansion in the

opportunity or is it more about making the devices even more inseparable from us? Thank you.

What we're trying to do with our payments work is that – sort of like what we've done on the Watch where we're
focused on helping people live a healthier day, on our financial products, we're helping people have a better
financial health. And so, things like the Apple Card and the fact that it has no fees, like the savings account which
has – as you mentioned, it's very attractive yield. So, we're trying to help our users, and these things – but these
things have to stand on their own obviously. But we're very user-focused, and so we're listening to them at what
things are – provide them pinch points and orchestrate our roadmaps around that. Buy now, pay later is another
one that we've just gotten out of the chute. But on the savings account specifically, we are very pleased with the
initial response on it. It's been incredible.

Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I just wanted to go back to maybe kind of dig into the restocking of
inventory in the channel versus what we're hearing from a demand perspective that appears to be a little bit softer
in the March quarter from some of your larger carriers that exhibited relatively weak upgrade rates. So, just want
to kind of get a sense for where you're seeing demand signals today vis-à-vis how you were thinking about it
maybe a month ago or even three months ago. And is there sort of an acceleration in demand or any sort of
signals that you might want to share with us at this point? And then, I have a follow-up.

I don't want to go into what we're seeing in Q3 other than the guidance that Luca has given. But for Q2, I think
you're probably referencing primarily US carriers. And if you look at our geographic distribution of our
performance, it was lower in the Americas, which is primarily predominantly the United States. And a part of that
is – I believe is macroeconomic. A part is that there were more promotional activity in the year-ago quarter. And
so, I think that's what you're seeing there. Where our results were really stellar during this quarter was really in the
emerging markets, and we couldn't be prouder of the results that we had there.

Great. That's helpful. And then, just quickly on services, are you seeing anything in terms of consumers' behavior
other than sort of the macro that you mentioned and tough comps on digital advertising and mobile gaming? Are
you seeing users of all the disparate services change in what they're using and how they're using it and time
spent with an Apple service, now that we're technically hopefully fully past COVID with China almost fully
reopened? I'm just trying to get a sense for how user or consumer behaviors changed over the last three to six
months. Thanks.

David, it's Luca. As you said, of course, we got the issue around the macroeconomic environment, particularly in
advertising and in mobile gaming. But outside of those areas, the behavior of customers continues to be pretty
consistent that we're doing particularly well, obviously, in some of the services that we've launched more recently
like payments, where our growth rates are very strong as the adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Card and now the
new services that Tim mentioned, and the adoption continues to increase.

Cloud is an area that continues to grow very consistently. Users want to store more photos and videos and more
content on their devices, and so they adopt our cloud services. And in general, the model in the App Store around
paid subscriptions continues to grow very strongly. I mentioned we now have more than 975 million paid
subscriptions on the platform, and that's almost twice as much what we had only three years ago. So, obviously,
the growth in subscriptions is very strong.

Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I can follow up on David's question here on services.
And in the past, pre-pandemic, the growth rate there was more about sort of mid-teens. The growth rates today
where you stand, even if I back out FX impact, is more about low double-digits. So, one of the questions that we
get often from investors and want to get your thoughts on is, even as the installed base growth seems to have





accelerated, are these more cyclical drivers that are depressing growth at this point from returning to that level or
do you see more of a roll-out on the monetization that you need to do to get back to those growth levels? And I
have a follow-up, please.

Samik, the areas where we are seeing the impact of the macro environment, as I mentioned, is digital advertising
– as you know, obviously, the macro environment is not helping on that front – and mobile gaming, where we've
seen a bit of a slowdown partly due to the macro environment, partly due to the fact that we had very elevated
usage during the COVID years. But outside of those areas, we continue to see very healthy growth rates.

Okay. And maybe if I can just follow up, this is more of a macro question. I don't know if, Luca, you or Tim want to
take this. But obviously, the macro is not sort of helpful at this point. But what you're sort of implying in terms of
your guide is momentum for your products remains pretty stable. You're actually guiding to a modest uptick ex FX
for the overall business. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of customer sort of spending trends, and overall,
does the consumer sort of continue to deteriorate in terms of spending patterns? And is your sort of momentum
here just a function of share gains? How should we think about sort of where the consumer is versus what your
products are doing independent of that?

Well, a part of it, Samik, is what Tim was talking about, we having great momentum in emerging markets, and
those are markets where our share is low. It gives us a great opportunity to grow over time. It also helps us with
the growth of the installed base, because you can imagine that in places where our market share is low, we tend
to add a lot of switchers, people that are new to the Apple ecosystem. That increases the installed base, and over
the longer term, it obviously improves our ability to monetize on services as well.

I have two as well. I guess first off on gross margins for the June quarter, they seem to be holding up fairly well,
especially given the fact that sales are going down on a sequential basis. So, Luca, I'm wondering if you can just
touch on what's driving the strength in gross margin sequentially that's offsetting the lack of leverage, if you may.
And then, I also notice that the range of your gross margin guide is 50 basis points. It's typically 100 basis points.
What does that entail? What does that mean?





Luca Maestri
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Apple, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                               A
So, you're right. I mean, we are guiding to a fairly stable level of gross margins at a very high level. We're very
happy with the gross margins that we're having this cycle. For the first time in several quarters, we expect foreign
exchange to be flat on a sequential basis at the gross margin level. Unfortunately, still a headwind at the revenue
level. But at gross margin level, sequentially, we expect foreign exchange not to be a factor. And so, the seasonal
loss of leverage that you're referring to, we expect to be offset by cost savings. And so, that should give us that
level of margins. As you know – you were asking about 50 basis points. We have guided to 50 basis points of a
range before as well. This year in particular, because of the 14th week in the – during the December quarter,
we're a bit late in the calendar year, right. And so, we have a bit more visibility around margins for the June
quarter.

Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Tim, if I just kind of go back to the India discussion a bit, perhaps you
could just contrast what you're seeing in India today versus what you saw in China maybe a decade or so ago. Is
that a reasonable ramp to think India would have or could it be different from the lessons you've seen in China?

I think each country is different and has their own journey. And so, I hesitate to compare too much. But what I do
see in India is a lot of people entering the middle-class, and I'm hopeful that we can convince some number of
them to buy an iPhone. And we'll see how that works out. But right now, it's working out well.

Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you have primarily been a
consumer-centric company. But it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad, hardware products being
used for corporate applications. So, is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from
enterprise versus consumer? And does the slower corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac,
et cetera? And then, I had a follow-up.

Internally, we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer, and the enterprise business is
growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs, and there's more and more companies that are
leaning into those and giving employees the ability to select, which plays to our benefit, I believe, because I think
a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. But we're certainly primarily a consumer company in
terms of our revenues obviously.

I'm just kind of curious, you also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of folks into iPhone there. Where do you
think the biggest opportunity is? Is it like primarily a hardware business like the iPhone, iPad, Wearables, et
cetera? Or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term too? Thank you very much.

I think there's an opportunity across the board including in services. Obviously, the ARPUs are lower in India for –
whether you're talking about TV and movie streaming or music, the ARPUs are much lower than other regions.
But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board.

Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question is, I want to go back to kind of the geographical
dynamics. I'm curious, as we all think about the reopening attributes of China, just how you would characterize the
shaping of demand you saw through the course of this last quarter and kind of how you're thinking about the
impact of that reopening playing out over the next couple quarters?

Yeah. If you look at China, our revenue came in at negative 3% for the quarter year-over-year, but we actually
grew on a constant currency basis. And we also accelerated as compared to the December quarter which, as you
know, had 14 weeks in it and was a negative 7% on a reported basis. And so, we were pleased with how we did





and with the acceleration that we saw with the reopening. And we'll see how we do this quarter. But if you look at
the top-selling smartphones in urban China based on a survey from Kantar, we have four out of the top five.

And I think in all of the third-party data I've seen on the market itself in the smartphone space, we believe we
gained share during Q2. So, we feel good about it. It also – China has a lot of very good metrics in terms of new
buyers. For example, on the Mac, about 6 out of 10 customers are buying the Mac for the first time. Same thing
on iPad. If you look over at the Watch, it's more than three out of four customers are buying the Watch for the first
time. And so, the buyer metrics, if you will, are very, very good. And our services business hit an all-time record in
China during the quarter.

Yeah. Very helpful, Tim. As a quick follow-up, I want to go back to Amit's question on gross margin. You talked
about FX, the lessening impact there. I'm just curious of when you look at our gross margin, obviously, you got
mix attributes kind of potentially continuing to drive that higher. But I'm curious on the current environment how
you would characterize the component pricing dynamics and what you're thinking about in this current quarter's
guidance.

March quarter, and we expect the same during the June quarter.

Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we can talk about the linearity of the March quarter and
perhaps the first 4.5 weeks of the current quarter. It looks like things are slowing down quite a bit elsewhere. But if
my math is right, your fiscal third quarter guidance implies product revenue will be a little bit lower than seasonal
average on a sequential basis. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.

Well, we said that we expect our performance during the June quarter at the revenue level to be similar to the one
that we just reported for the March quarter. Keep in mind, we always have differences in the launch timing across
our products and also that especially over the last few years, we've seen a certain amount of supply disruptions.
Sometimes, it was COVID-related. Sometimes, it was related to specific component shortages. Just to remind





you, in the June quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the launch for both of the iPhone SE and the
iPad Air, which leads to a more difficult compare. So, I think it's important to keep those things in mind.

The feedback for both Apple Pay Later and the savings product have both been really good, and we think both of
them help customers live a better – or a healthier financial life. And so, we're very excited about the first days of
both of them.

Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, you're one of the largest chip companies. You're not a
component maker. You actually use your own products. But we almost never hear in any context of you guys
being a beneficiary – Apple being a beneficiary for either the CHIPS Act money or the R&D tax credit that's being
proposed. I was just curious if you're eligible for any of those. And then, I've got a follow-up.

I don't see Apple participating in the CHIPS Act directly. But we would be a beneficiary indirectly, because some
of our partners would hopefully be recipients of it, and therefore, put in additional capacity. And so, on that sort of
indirect basis, we would have a benefit.

Understood, and thanks for the clarification. And Luca, I wanted to clarify your comments about June. When
you're saying June performance will be similar to March, I assume on a year-on-year basis, which would be June
should be down about 2-something-odd-percent. Is that a fair way? And then, my question that I wanted to ask –
maybe another one for Tim was where do you think is the largest opportunity in your services offering? I mean,
you're doing a great job. You just set a record, but surely there must be areas where you think you can do better.

Harsh, I think we can do better on everything. And so, I wouldn't just point to one of them. If you look at the
number of active devices and the growth of active devices, I think our services are underpenetrated in a number
of different ways. And so, the way that I look at it is there is opportunity in many of them.
