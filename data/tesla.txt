Elon Reeve Musk
Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.
Thank you, Martin. So just a Q3 recap, our last quarter was impacted by downtime for global factory upgrades,
that will help us reduce cost per vehicle, as well increased production. We remain focused on three main
objectives, which is the cost reductions of our products, investments in artificial intelligence and other growth
projects like Optimus, and continued free cash flow generation.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call                                                                                        18-Oct-2023

Regarding vehicle costs, our team was able to reduce the cost per vehicle further in Q3, despite headwinds from
factory idle cost and ramp-up of new factories, and we believe there's still meaningful room for improvement
there.

Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles have now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD Beta, Full Self-Driving
Beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000-GPU cluster of H100s, we think
probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's ever brought that much compute per unit time into
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with Full Self-Driving and vehicle
autonomy.

We're also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it's photon count in,
controls out, or really, you can think of it as just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out,
compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work. The vast majority
of human data input is optics from our eyes. And so, we are, like the car, photons in, controls out, with neural nets
– just neural nets in the middle. It's very interesting to think about that.

We'll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the massive game changer. And I mean,
success in this regard in the long term, I think, has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the
world by far. If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly
useful, it's not clear what the limit is.

Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3. And as this
business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute
over $0.5 billion dollars to quarterly profit.

The Cybertruck, I know that people are excited about Cybertruck. I am, too. I've driven the car. It's an amazing
product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the
Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This is simply normal for – when you've got a
product with a lot of new technology or any brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and
advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve
at scale. So I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever, in fact, I think it is
our best product ever, it is going to be – require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow
positive at a price that people can afford.

Often, people do not understand what is truly hard. That is why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
People think it's the idea where you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon as [ph] they're designing
the (00:05:42) car is, it's not just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a
prototype. But the difficulty then for a prototype to volume production is like 10,000% harder to get volume
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash
flow. That is why there have not been new car start-ups that have been successful for 100 years, apart from
Tesla.

So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product, but financially, it will take, I don't know,
a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor. I wish there was some way for that to
be different, but that's my best guess. Demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million people who have reserved
the car, so it's not a demand issue, but we have to make it, and we need to make it a price that people can afford,
insanely difficult things.

In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow, and we continue
to target and expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year. The Tesla AI team is,
I think, one of the world's best, and I think it is actually by far the world's best when it comes to real-world AI. I'll
say that again, Tesla has the best real-world AI team on earth, period, and it's getting better.

And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you're making.

Martin Viecha
Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.
Thank you very much, Elon, and our CFO, Vaibhav, have some opening remarks as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Vaibhav Taneja
Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.
Thanks, Martin. Our vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of
profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continued focus on operational
excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer
sentiment.

As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our
factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500. We saw sequential
decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.

On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot
production testing, combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo. We have and
will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to
grow in the near term.

However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself,
we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cash flows of approximately $2.3
billion. Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis, with energy business leading
the charge primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments. Our services and other businesses on a year-on-
year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet.

As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car
buying happens with one or other form of financing. And hence, we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for
the customer. And therefore as interest costs in the US have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the
price of our vehicles to keep the monthly costs [ph] intact (00:10:14). We've tried to offset such adjustments via
our focus on reducing costs. However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the US, whereby you can get a
standard range Model Y for as low as $399 a month.

In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we're focused on reducing costs,
maximize delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular AI and other next-
generation platform. We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term. Once again, I would like to thank
the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.

Thank you very much. And now let's go to investor questions. The first investor question comes from [ph] Craig
(00:11:08). How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?

Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                A
[ph] I struggle (00:11:16) to make an accurate guess at this point. Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp
is going to be extremely difficult. And it's like – so there's no way around that. If you try to make – if we just try to
do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the
combustion engine world, just distinctions without a difference, then it's really not that hard. But if you want to do
something radical and innovative and something really special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because
there's nothing to copy. You have to invent not just a car but the way to make the car.

So, the more uncharted the territory, less predictable the outcome. Now I can say that if you say, well, where will
things end up, I think we'll end up with roughly 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year. But I don't think we're going to
reach that output rate next year. But I think we'll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That's my best guess.

Thank you. The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularly progress
towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day? Thank you.

Sure thing, Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Congrats to the Texas
team for producing their 20 million cell off of Line 1. Texas is now our primary 4680 facility. We're heavily focused
on quality. Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter. With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell
costs consistently improved month-over-month within the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to
achieve our steady-state goals. And that is our priority.

The Cybertruck cell, with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell, started production on Line 2 in Texas. This
quarter, we converted to building 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines
in Phase 1 over the next three quarters. Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction. The
additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase 1, and our target is for them to start
producing in late 2024.

Lastly, in Kato, our retooling to enable large-scale pilot runs of our next-generation cell designs, Kato's long-term
goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities enabling faster
iteration and smoother ramp-ups of new designs.

Thank you. The next question from institutional investors, could you please provide an update on capacity
expansion plans for company's factories in Berlin and Austin and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
Berlin and Austin factory, the current priority is actually to maximize the output from our existing lines by laser
focus on efficiency improvements. As always, maintaining a high quality and reducing per unit costs will be as
critical as growing production volume. For Mexico, we are working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel
with the engineering development of the new production that we will be manufacturing there. That's all I can share
for now.

Yeah. In Mexico, we're laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items, but I think
we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory.

I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in. I just can't emphasize this enough that the
vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. And as interest rates rise, the proportion of
that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally. So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher,
it's that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply cannot afford it.

And we are tracking, I believe, at this point for Model Y to be the best-selling car on earth, but not just in revenue
but in unit volume. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot,
they cost much less than our car. So, we're just hitting law of large numbers situations here.

I know people want us to advertise, and we are advertising. I think there is something to be gained on the
advertising front. I don't think it's nothing. But imploring people of a car that is great but they cannot afford doesn't
really help. So, that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable, or the average person
cannot buy it for any amount of money. They can't afford it. They can't afford it, so this is big deal.

Okay. Thank you very much. The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the
US? I just wanted to address that unfortunately, we don't answer product-related questions and timings on
earnings calls, so let's go to the next one.

Current sell-side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth
versus 2023 guidance. Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024, and when does
Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?

Thanks for the question. When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces. Elon just talked about what is
happening in the macroeconomic environment. So, we're focused on growing our volumes in a very cost-efficient
manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we'll be able to provide a much more meaningful update
at our next earnings call.

Yeah. I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever,
or you will exceed the mass of the known universe. But I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any
other car company on earth by far.

Thank you. Next question is, do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the Robotaxi driven or non-driven?
What excites you most about how this project is progressing?

Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                A
Well, the Robotaxi is, like, necessarily non-driven. I guess I am very excited about our progress with autonomy.
The end-to-end nothing but nets self-driving software is amazing. Drives me all around Austin with no
interventions, so it's clearly the right move. So, it's really pretty amazing. And also that same software and
approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking,
so extremely exciting in long term.

As I mentioned before, given that the company output is number of people times productivity, if you no longer
have a constraint on people, effectively you got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you'd like, your
economy is quasi-infinite or infinite for all intents and purposes. And I don't think anyone is going to do it better
than Tesla, not by a long shot.

Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a brain. They're like the Wizard of Oz or [ph] whatever
(00:20:45). And then you also need to be able to design humanoid robots in such a way that it can be mass
manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots. Now, so we need to make sure
that there's a good place for humans in that future and we do not create some variance of the Terminator
outcome. So we're going to put a lot of effort into localized controller for humanoid robots. So basically anyone will
be able to shut it off locally. And you can't change that even if you put like a software update, you can't change
that. That has to be hardcoded.

so soon?

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it, yeah. I think over time, the price of FSD will
increase proportionate to its value, so the current price has a kind of a temporary low.

Thank you. The next question is again on FSD. Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3
autonomous driving system Drive Pilot is active. Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD? And if so,
when?

Well, there's a lot of people that assume we have legal liability, judging by the lawsuits. We're certainly not being
let off the hook on that front, whether we'd like to or wouldn't like to, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
And I think it's important to remember for everyone that Mercedes' system is limited to a few roads in Nevada and
some certain cities in California, doesn't work in the snow or the fog, it must have a [indiscernible] (00:22:54), only
40 miles per hour. Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any condition. So we obviously have a much
more capable approach, but with those kind of limitations, it – really not very useful.

No, I think some people understand the profundity of a Tesla AI system. But it's very, very few. It's basically baby
AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive, baby AGI.

I think at this point, we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but we will make – provide
periodic updates online. So, as you can see, where Optimus a year ago could barely walk, and now it can do
yoga, so a few years from now, it can probably do ballet.

Sounds good. And the last question from investors is, neural net path planning represent a significant advance in
capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the US?

Yeah. Our approach has been to try to get it – like the more places we try to make it work, the harder the problem
is. So, the reason we don't do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work
anywhere at all. So, that's why it's currently just North America.

And also, for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the US, you
can deploy things at risk, or at least you can take liability for what you're deploying. So it's a – whereas most

countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So, we only want to go through that extensive
approval program when we think it's kind of ready for primetime in that country.

I apologize that it's not out in those countries, but we keep finding ways to make it better, and it needs to drive
such that it exceeds the even unsupervised – significantly exceeds the probability of injury of a human or
significantly better, a lower probability of injury than a human by far. I think we're tracking to that point very
quickly.

Obviously, in the past, I've been overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimistic is that the
progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initial improvements, and then if
you were to extrapolate that sort of rapid fairly linear rate of improvement, you get to self-driving quite quickly. But
then, I think the rate of improvement curves over logarithmically and starts to asymptote.

That's now happened several times. I would characterize our progress in real-world AI as a series of stacked log
curves. I think that is also true in other parts of AI like LLMs and whatnot, series of stacked log curves. Each log
curve gets higher than the last one, but if you keep stacking them, keep stacking logs, eventually you get to FSD.

Great. Thanks so much for taking my question, and thanks for all the updates today. We learned earlier in the call,
it sounds like you don't think the truck will ramp to significant volume until its third year of production. Should we
have a similar anticipation for the ramp of the next-gen platform? Or is there any reason that we should be maybe
more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there? Thank you.

Yeah. I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production. It's kind of like the 18th month of production is
roughly my guess. So, it's just that they happen just – it will happen...

It starts this year, spans next year, and I guess to 2025. So, technically, there are three calendar years in there,
but there's actually only 18 months, not three years.

I would be very disappointed if it took us – it would be shocking if it took us three years. But 18 months from initial
deliveries to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense – I can't tell you how much blood, sweat, and
tears level it required to achieve that. It's just staggering. I've been through it many times, and then here we go
again.

Yeah. I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck. In general, nobody digs their grave better than themselves.
And so, Cybertruck is one of those really special products that comes along only once in a long while. And special
products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market to reach volume to be
prosperous. It's fundamental to the nature of the newness. So, now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller
vehicle is actually much more conventional.

It is. Yes, it's – the manufacturing approach for the high-volume small vehicle is revolutionary, but not
revolutionary quite in the same way as Cybertruck. I think it will be quite a fast ramp. So, as I was just saying,
we're doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a unit per minute level that is unheard
of in the auto industry.

I have, first, like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption. So, I agree with you that as FSD
improves, we should see its value increasing. But the idea is like the ultimate value of FSD, which is to be able to
handle like a Robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version
that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
And then there is like the hands on, eyes on version of the service.

And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a
very large penetration on your install base and more expensive one that would remain at the lower penetration
level. So, I'm just wondering if you're taking that.

And last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD are available and are going to work from a technical
perspective probably before like the ultimate Robotaxi version can work, if ever. And so, I'm wondering how you
take that into account, how you are thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time, and whether it could
evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.

Yeah. A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, you know sort of the economics of a fully autonomous vehicle
are truly astounding in a positive way. When you look at [ph] past (00:34:30) vehicles today, they only get about
10 hours to 12 hours of usage per week. If you drive an hour and a half a day on average, that's roughly 10 hours
a week out of 168 hours. And then there's also you got to have parking and insurance, and you got to take care of
the car. It's like there's a lot of overhead. So – I mean, yeah.

It's – like the economics of the system are just insanely positive, given that all of the cars we're making and have
made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy. So, then if you're able to, say, increase the utility of
that car by, I don't know, a factor of five, which still only means that [ph] you'd been used (00:35:28) for maybe 50
hours a week out of 168 hours, so that still assumes less than a third of the hours of the week, it is doing

Yes. I have a few follow-up on a different topic for you, Vaibhav, if that's okay. It's about like your gross margin in
the quarter. Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially? How much was the
impact of idle costs? How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and
Austin? And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, a very strong positive surprise. So if you can
give us some background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.

Hi, Pierre, thanks for that question. So, in terms of – you have a few different aspects of your question. So, if I just
look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact. It did impact by – I mean, I won't give you
the exact percentage, but it had decent impact for the quarter. And when you look at the other pieces which we're
trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, and they actually contributed pretty
well to the margin for this quarter. In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to, in terms of per unit costs, to
where we are for one of our other established factories, which is Fremont. So, that was a positive in the quarter.

When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there, and that product has done
well. I mean, on the cost curve also, we've been able to do a lot there. But I do want to caution that Megapack
deployments are a bit lumpy. So yes, we had a great quarter this period, but depending upon where we are trying
to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods wherein there would be downward pressure on
deployment because of us trying to get the product to that [indiscernible] (00:38:22).

Thanks. Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took. You've taken
now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle cost over the past year. Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate
of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded to? Is there a
way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here? And then related to that, can
you share the timing of your next-gen – the lower priced product that you talked about earlier this year?

Yeah. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look into this. There are
certain things which we control and there are certain things which we don't control. We expect that we'll get some
benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are underway. And on the other hand, we just finished our factory
upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4. We're still not up to where we
want those factories to be severely impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we're going to be ramping
Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind which we look in dealing with.

On top of all that, there's overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to
predict precisely as to where we land. But just this is something which – it's an evolving thing which we're
observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not – we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional
cost-downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory
operations side. And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw. We're trying as hard as we
possibly can.

Okay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that's obviously not happening in a
vacuum. And you mentioned that – I think you mentioned that at some point during this call, that you're also
maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you just share how you're thinking about
price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment, and any thoughts along those lines?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call                                                                                                                                                                                                                   18-Oct-2023

I think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean, to tell you frankly, if our car costs the same as a RAV4,
nobody would buy a RAV4, or at least that very unlikely to.

It's worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, that they're actually very difficult for
the average person to access because most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500 burning a hole in their
bank account. A large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and with a lot of debt. They got credit
card debt, mortgage debt. So, that's reality for most people. It's sometimes difficult for people who are high-
income earners. When I say high, it'd be like somebody who's earning over $200,000 a year to understand what
life is like for someone who is earning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.

So that like – for a lot of people, like these tax credits just – they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6
months to get – for the tax credit, and they actually don't, in some cases, even have that $7,500 in taxes. So, it's
really just the vast majority of people is how much money do they have to pay immediately and how much per
month, that's it, [indiscernible] (00:43:08) right there. And our car is so much more expensive than a RAV4 when
you look at it that way.

Now one other thing which I'll add, when you look at car buying in general, we're trying to get to the next set of EV
adaptors. When they use...

It's not – sometimes, you get these like – honestly, I'd say it's like somewhat correlates with the why-doesn't-
everyone-work-from-home crowd. I'm like, I mean, this is like some real [ph] Marie Antoinette vibes (00:43:48)
from people who say why doesn't everyone work from home. Like what about all the people that have to come to
the factory and build the cars? What about all the people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food
and deliver your food? It's like what are you talking about. I mean, how detached from reality does – is the work-
from-home crowd have to be while they take advantage of all of those who do – who cannot work from home? So
I mean, you have to say, like why did I sleep in the factory so many times? Because it mattered.

So I just can't emphasize enough how, again, how important cost is. It's not an optional thing for most people. It is
a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy it. And I keep harping on this
interest thing, but I mean, it just raises the cost of the car. I mean, we're looking at an internal analysis which I
know we – like we think is more or less on track, that when you look at the cost – or the price reductions we've
made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to how much people's monthly payment has risen due to interest
rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.

Yes, which is – that is what I'm trying to say. The thing that matters is the monthly pay – it's how much money do
you have to put down and do that [ph] lift we (00:45:38) have that in their bank account or will the check bounce.
And then what is the monthly payment, and it doesn't matter how – if that monthly payment is principal interest or
whatever, it's just a number, and that number has to not cause their bank account to go negative. That's it. So
going from near zero interest rates to the current very high interest rates, the actual monthly payment is basically
the same. It's just a bunch more of it is going to interest.

And there's some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has increased,
and so the number of people who simply cannot get credit, period. Even if they've got a job and everything's solid,
the banks are a little gun shy on handing out credit, given that a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.

Yeah. And there's also just fewer options. Even if they're able to hand down credit, there's fewer banks to go to.

Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish a relationship with a new bank. And so, a lot of regional
banks are [ph] tight (00:46:56) and, I mean, even Credit Suisse. I mean, jeez, that was a shocker. Got a like 160
year old-ish Swiss institution that doesn't exist anymore. That's mind-blowing.

And I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation. I think commercial real estate
obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt has been rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are
usurious, probably over 20% interest rates, meaning like which over time, it just becomes obviously extremely
punishing. Because if somebody is paying 20% interest on their credit cards, it means they cannot pay them off.
And if you cannot pay them off and you're still accruing interest at 20%, that's headed to a bad place.

Thank you for taking my question. Just to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters, as you
discussed in your written remarks, I'm curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factory
utilization, is it material cost reductions, the things like gigacasting? I mean, could you just kind of give us some
data points to give us confidence that that's going to come down over time?

And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports, and I know how perilous it is to believe some of these.
But they say that you've included radar as an option in some Model Y's in China, and I'm just here to ask if that's
true, and if so, why? Thank you.

We've not included radar. No. We have radar as – a Tesla-designed radar is an experiment in the Model S/X.
That's it. We'll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrate radar into Model 3/Y.
Now just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety simply with
their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just with vision far, far, far, because, I mean, the car
is looking at all directions at once, we don't have eyes in the back of our head. And the computer never gets tired
and never gets distracted. Get drunk, hopefully.

And so, radar is – what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. And in order for
the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking or you have to do actions that are radar-
only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision and radar. That's why we actually turned off
the radar in cars historically that we had shipped. All Model 3/Y used to radar but we turned it off because the
radar actually generated more noise than signal.

Now, the Tesla-designed radar is a high-resolution radar that has some potential to be useful, but the jury is still
very much out on whether that is in fact the case. On the cost saving?

On the cost question, I guess, from the vehicle side, like as Drew mentioned earlier, we are always trying to
engineer our products to be cheaper to make and more efficient to make. That comes, obviously, on the
engineering side as we come up with new innovations, but as well on the supply chain side with our partners. We
work with them to automate some of their lines, remove their bottlenecks and their high costs as well, on the
logistics side, getting parts to the factory. It's not – you can go ahead.

Yeah. I mean, I would say there's a whole lot of list of things which we are chasing. We internally call it the cost
attack where we're literally going line by line and saying how can we make it better. And it's a grind.

It's like Game of Thrones but pennies. I mean, first approximation, if you've got a $40,000 car and roughly 10,000
items in that car, that means each thing on average costs $4. So in order to get the cost down, say, by 10%, you
have to get $0.40 out of each part on average. It is a game of pennies.

Yeah. We've done it many, many times. And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there's too many
stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees. It's something as simple as a QR code. You might think, well,
putting a QR code on a part, why not just put them on there. It's like, well, are we actually going to use that QR
code?

Yeah, absolutely. It's chipping away with – I mean, it is trying to – it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up. That would also bring
some savings from higher production. Then on the flip side, we're going to be ramping a new product like
Cybertruck, which we talked about. So yeah, so those are the real puts and takes which we are working through.

Yeah. But there's not like some accidentally some goal – like a goal that we've left in the car, unfortunately, and
it's – we're trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because any fool can
reduce the cost of the car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability, but that does sound

pounds right away, well, you can chop your arm off but then you're sitting there with one arm. You're still fat. So

Yeah. So super fun because food is delicious, and personally, I don't love working out. I know some people do, I
wish I did, but I don't, unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.

Great. Thanks for taking my question. You said in the commentary that you're not going full tilt on the plant in
Mexico until there are signs that the economy is strong. Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? And
where would that come from? And any color on what you mean sort of not going full tilt? Could that plant get
delayed indefinitely or what are you kind of talking about?

No. We're definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We've put a lot of effort into
looking at locations and feel very good about that location, and we are going to build a factory there and it's going
to be great.

The question is really just one of timing, and it's going to be a broken record on the interest front. It's just interest
rates have to come down. Like if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability. It is just the
same as increasing the price of the car. So, I just don't have visibility into it. If you can tell me what the interest
rates are, I can tell you when we should build the factory. We're going to build it, and I really think we'll start the
initial phase of construction next year.

But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. So – well, that's now
14 years ago. That is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread
during that entire time. I mean, when we closed our financing round 2008 at 6:00 PM, December 24, Christmas
Eve, and if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas. So,
we actually closed that round on the last hour of the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and
then barely made it through 2009.

So, I'm like I want to just – I don't want to be going at top speed into uncertainty. A lot of wars going on in the
world obviously as well. So, we have room here like in Giga Texas. We still have it in this building. It's not full with
Cybertruck and Model Y, and there's plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team
already is.

We're obviously only occupying a tiny quarter of land that we own, but we could technically do all the scaling just
here. So I mean, personnel is our biggest challenge and that the Greater Austin area only has – generously, the
Greater Austin area only has 2 million people. So if you are moving here and are they're willing to move here but
there is somewhat of a housing crisis, they got to live somewhere. So, yeah.

So, I don't know. I mean, I'm just curious – like I'm not saying things will be bad. I'm just saying they might be. And
I think like Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure, like if the macroeconomic conditions are
stormy, even the best ship is still going to have tough times. The weaker ships will sink. We're not going to sink.
But even a great ship in a storm, it has challenges. That storm will apply to everyone, not just us and not just the
auto industry. It'll apply to everyone, I think, so apart from necessary sort of staples like food and stuff, but – so I
just – I don't know. If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate.

If anybody's got any guesses on this, I'd love to be less wrong. And I apologize if I'm perhaps more paranoid than
I should be, because that might also be the case, because I have PTSD from 2009 big time, and then 2017
through 2019 were no picnic either. There was very tough going. So, the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic
because people tend to hesitate to buy a new car if there's uncertainty in the economy. So car companies do very
well in good economic times, and they don't do as well in tough economic times. So, it's – whereas if somebody's
selling bread, then I think people still need to have bread. Yeah.
