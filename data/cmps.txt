MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

Charles C. Duncan
Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
I think we should get started here. My name is Charles Duncan. I'm a biotech analyst for Cantor. And it's a
pleasure to introduce – for me to introduce the first presenting company of the second day of the 2023 Cantor
Global Healthcare Conference. This is COMPASS Pathways. COMPASS is a really innovative company. It's a
company that I've covered for a couple of years, and it is a company that is developing a proprietary form of
psilocybin for the treatment of mental health disorders, generally, with a Phase 3 – the largest Phase 3 being
conducted ever in treatment resistant depression with this type of agent. So, I'm excited to introduce
management.

Luckily, we are spared having Michael Falvey, the numbers guy here. He is not here. But we have Steve and
Steve. Steve and Steve are guys that can tell us a little bit about Compass. Steve Schultz is going to give us an
overview, and then Steve...

Yeah. Thank you, Charles, and thanks for having us. We really appreciate the invitation. And before we begin, we
will be making forward-looking statements. So, in that light, we recommend that you look at the risk factors in our
SEC filings. So, I'm Steve Schultz. I head up IR for the company. Dr. Steve Levine is Head of Patient Access

Medical Affairs. He's got really, really interesting background in interventional psychiatry. He is a psychiatrist. So, I

So, you know, as Charles said, Compass Pathways is a mental healthcare company. We have – we're focused on
therapeutic areas of significant unmet need. We have a lead product candidate called COMP360, which is a
proprietary psilocybin medicine that we combine with support services. And we're currently running a Phase 3
program for COMP360 in treatment-resistant depression, and that's two trials in that Phase 3 program.

There are – they're very different trials. We probably get into that in a little bit more detail. But the recruitment for
those trials is on track. One trial is due to read out primary endpoint in the summer of 2024. The second trial is
due to read out mid-2025. Beyond treatment-resistant depression, we also have ongoing Phase 2 studies in
PTSD and in anorexia nervosa. So that's the – a high level overview.

That's a great overview. It's a fast overview. I appreciate that because there are a lot of questions that I had to
ask, but I wanted to ask Steve Levine. Interventional psychiatrist. Why would it be that you have interest in joining
this very innovative have interest in joining this very innovative company.

Now, that is a great question, Charles. You know, my pathway has been a little bit twisty turny. I started early in
my career primarily focused on psychotherapy, maybe more so than biological psychiatry. But back in 2010, I
became interested in some of the research at that point on the repurposing of the old anesthetic ketamine for
psychiatric indications, and wound up developing models of care that were appropriate to deliver ketamine given
that to that point, they didn't exist.

Like most mental health care or at least the biological side at that point was in small offices, solo psychiatrists,
maybe small groups of psychiatrists or therapists, and primarily prescribing treatments that were written on a pad
and taken as daily oral therapies at home.

Not really built to deliver more complex and in some ways more medicalized treatments that required some
component of monitoring, observation, other support, you know, really more administratively and operationally
complex treatments.

The development of ketamine in that way, the later FDA approval of J&J's S ketamine product really spawned the
birth of this more interventional psychiatry field, which also includes some of the neuromodulation techniques like
TMS, which is transcranial magnetic stimulation. But there remains some significant barriers to patient access for
these treatments, some additional opportunities to really ensure that this sadly, very large population of patients
who aren't adequately benefiting from your traditional antidepressant treatments were able to receive care.

And having on the provider side and having built, you know, networks of centers that were built to deliver
interventional treatments, seen some of the challenges and recognizing that COMP360 challenges in recognizing
that COMP360 was going to face some similar challenges and potentially more in some ways. It was a very
interesting opportunity to be able to come in and start to address some of these challenges early, well ahead of a
commercial launch, as opposed to trying to figure them out in that commercial environment.

So it sounds like you were really motivated by a couple of factors, one of them being really a rapidly evolving or
an evolving treatment paradigm, which had existed before in psychiatry to more intermittent, more interventional
therapy. You know, perhaps also new mechanisms, new drugs that hadn't been there before. I guess the question
that I have for you is, do you think – when I was doing diligence earlier in the decade or about a decade ago, I
would talk to psychiatrists and they'd say, you know, ketamine, it's the biggest thing, you know, and I know some
of the guys from Yale who were involved in their earlier observations. You know, this is the biggest thing that hit
psychiatry and locked up. Do you think it's lived up to its potential? And if not, why and will [indiscernible]

Yeah, that is a great question. You know, I will say that a lot of my initial interest in building models to deliver
ketamine, where it necessarily so specific to ketamine itself.

Right. It is a differentiated mechanism of action relative to the SSO rise. It represented a new option for patients
that need multiple tools because nobody's going to you know, it's not a tool we have yet where every single
patient in this population is going to benefit. But what was more compelling was looking at emerging trends in
care delivery in psychiatry that were starting around then. And it's certainly accelerated now to more of an
interventional model.

And – and certainly, COMP360 represents, I think, one of the most promising examples of represents, I think, you
know, one of the most promising examples of that. And so, ketamine has its limitations in terms of abuse liability,
addiction potential.

And in many cases, probably not quite as durable as we might have hoped. Rapidly acting, but requires relatively
frequent, ongoing administration and maintenance. But what it really has done is help to develop and start
working towards a more mature field that continues to evolve, this evolving trend of rapid acting treatments that –
that are delivered in person. And I think that in-person model has a lot of advantages over medicines being taken
orally at home in kind of a vacuum, essentially.

So, yeah, clear that the treatment paradigm has evolved or is evolving. I guess, the one thing and you kind of
alluded to this is still missing is a good drug, a good medicine. And so, I guess, I'm wondering if you could provide
us some perspective when Compass came calling or did you go calling Compass? What was it about this agent
that was interesting to?

relationship with Compass even prior to joining.

a single administration over the longer term in a very well-tolerated form. And also in, you know, a model that very
much fits my conception of optimal care, which is more comprehensive, you know, not just thinking about a drug

Stephen, you mentioned or Steve you mentioned that you were interested in, in psilocybin and some of its
activities relative to, say, and esketamine or maybe I'm reading into a comment that you made. And then it's when
you think about the care paradigm that you can imagine with COMP360, right? How do you – how do you think
about the burden of care and how do you – how do you think about the capacity issues that may – may be
perceived to – to – to exist relative to certainly an esketamine paradigm?

That's a really important question, one that we get in a number of ways from many different stakeholder groups.
Because on the surface, if you – if you start with esketamine and although the protocol for delivering that is for
more administrations.

It's eight in the first month, twice weekly for the first four weeks.

then weekly in the second month, so another four administrations, and then maintenance on a weekly, every
other weekly, maybe monthly basis from there.

It's been hard. It also is somewhat shorter administration. Patients are in the office maybe four or three hours, as
opposed to our six- to eight-hour long administration day. And it's a more passive monitoring protocol. But it is
frequent. And so, when you take that on the surface versus our protocol within our trials on the surface, which is,
you know, just one administration, but it's a longer day that six to eight hours. And there is a therapist that's in the
room with the patient the whole time. And it's preceded by some preparatory sessions, which are non-drug
sessions and then followed by integration sessions. That can sound very resource intensive.

I think it's important, though, to recognize the context of that, which is that this is within a clinical trial setting.

And so, necessarily, you're taking a core out of a longer patient journey. It's bracketed, and there needs to be a
beginning, a middle, and an end. In real-world use, I think what we would envision post-approval in a real-world
environment is these patients, those with chronic recurrent depression and treatment resistant depression,
already are in care.

You know, almost always they are having a relationship with somebody prescribing medications to them and in
most cases also in therapy. And there will likely – will be less of a bright line difference between the care that's
ongoing and having COMP360.

And when you start to think about it that way in a single longer administration day versus, you know, many, many,
many administrations over time and the fact that there's so much overlap in the resources required to deliver
esketamine and that's now developed and will continue to scale prior to our launch launch and what's required for
COMP360, you know all of a sudden, those additional resources don't look so additional.

Yeah. And forgetting about the durability question, which we'll get to in a – in a minute. The other thing that you
mentioned in kind of the discussion we just had was the interaction of the medicine with the therapy, if you will.
And it makes sense to me that a person who is not your garden variety depressed patient, a treatment resistant
depression patient could benefit from therapy.

But there is a discussion at the – at some level regularly regulators, probably professionals involved in the – in the
industry as to the importance of the therapy versus the medicine. Do you make that distinction or do you think that
the distinction can be made? And is that a complexifier for the regulatory oversight of the medicine?

You know, in some ways we do make that distinction and it is important. So, approaching that from a few angles,
you know, first of all, I think to your point, FDA clearly regulates the development of drugs as medicines and

And so, it's very important that in the conducting of our trials that we demonstrate a drug effect. And I think, you
know, if we look at our outcomes in Phase 2 with our three arm design, 25, 10, and 1 milligrams of our COMP360
psilocybin combined with our model of support, you do see a dose response and it seems pretty suggestive of a
drug effect.

Right. It's psychotherapy that's catalyzed by a drug, and it's a fairly intensive model of 3 administrations and 12
psychotherapy sessions. Ours really is quite different from that in the sense of it, you know, being focused on the
effect of this drug that we think is doing the work, but creating the appropriate safe conditions by providing some
support around that.

Okay. That's helpful. And as the audience will know, one of the big issues with COMP360 or the historical
perspective of psilocybin and other such drugs is the safety, right? And so, you're enabling a safe administration.
And so, the drug can have a biological effect that hopefully help people.

Let's talk about that help people part. So, you as a psychiatrist, let's ask the question about durability. You know,
Wall Street wants a number. Okay. Is this going to work for three months or six months or whatever and in how
many patients in how many patients, and what is the effect, size, etcetera? How would you evaluate the efficacy
of COMP360 best? What are you most interested in seeing turnover in COMP 005? And there's a separate
questions in COMP 006, the second phase here?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
Yeah, great question. So, there's – I guess I'll take those two parts separately. What are we looking for in terms of
efficacy and then the durability component of that, right?

Maybe they are different in some ways, in the sense of as a psychiatrist, I'm really thinking about serving the
patient that's in front of me and in a way that's differentiated from the other options available today.

And – and so I think that perhaps maybe reflective of perhaps what psychiatrist out in the field may also see as
important and differentiating, right? And in some ways, that bar may be lower than what we anticipate, what we
hope for as a result of our trials.

We know we can exceed the hopes and dreams of psychiatrists out there because, you know, if you look at the
options available right now to this population of patients with major depressive disorder who have not benefited
from multiple treatment attempts so far, it's the repetition of other oral antidepressants that they've already been
shown not really to benefit from.

Yeah. Exactly. The addition of adjunctive drugs that come with heavy side effect burdens and modest efficacy at
best.

And then some other maybe more interventional treatments that that in many cases offer a more rapid benefit to a
subset of those patients, but may not be particularly durable and require some ongoing treatment to maintain that.
So, as a psychiatrist, if I had a new option that was rapidly acting and had a favorable side effect profile, had the
advantage of being just one or two initial administrations, you know, even if that was not particularly durable, that
would be quite exciting on its own.

But durable. So, stuff happens. Each year, you know, stuff happens. People are exposed to the fall, the winter,
whatever. So durability, it just seems like if you showed an effect that could last for three months or so in a decent

Well, you know, if we look at the existing evidence – and thank you for smiling at that. If we look at the existing
evidence in this treatment resistant population, the best example probably to look at would be the STAR*D study.

Right. The likelihood as you proceed through each step of remitting is diminishing this small. And then you look at
our results in Phase 2b and see that about 30% of patients were in remission at our primary endpoint, and about
25% of patients had a sustained response while...

There still are questions there that we need to answer in our phase 2b study. You know, we had a primary
endpoint of three weeks. We – but we followed patients out to 12 weeks. Still statistically significant at six weeks.
Even though powered for three and, numerically, still a nice separation after 12 weeks, with twice as many
responders and limiters in the 25 milligram group versus the one.

But in phase 3, with our 52-week designs in both of our pivotal studies with elements of – of retreatment, we will
be able to in a much better way and with the maintenance of the numbers through that study because it's all
included within one study.

Well, that's a good segue. It's very sophisticated. And I think, fulsome phase 3 program. But you brought it up
COMP 006. I wanted to ask you about the scientific or clinical question that's being asked. We only have about
five minutes, so let's – let's do that. And, then, we'll maybe transition to a few other subjects.

COMP 006 is different. It's a second dose. It's a prescribed second administration. So, what do you think that's
going to do for patients? You know, because you're – you're giving that after three weeks. You don't really know if
they've responded based on the six-week endpoint of COMP 005. So, what do you think that's going to do for
patient? You expect a higher effect size or – or a higher response rate or what do you expect of COMP 005
versus COMP 005?

Yeah. So as a reminder, this COMP 006 design is a 52-week study. It's divided into three parts. Part A is the first
six weeks and it's initial administrations at a fixed interval three weeks apart, and then patients continue into Part
B, which remains blinded out to 26 weeks where they're eligible for a single retreatment if they've not yet
responded or have responded, but now relapsed. And then at week 26 through week 52, the open label portion
where everybody is eligible for the 25 milligram dose.

What we're attempting to learn more about with that two-dose paradigm is based upon at least initially, some pilot
data, largely the Imperial Study, which used two administrations, also feedback from PIs within our Phase 2b
study who in some cases felt that patients who ultimately weren't responders to a single administration might have
benefited from a second administration.

So, we'll get information about whether there's increased depth of response with that second administration,
whether that response may be more durable beyond that six-week endpoint, and whether we may have more
responders over a matters with a second administration.

So one is, you know, first of all, how's enrollment going, really COMP 006, is COMP 006 progressing? I know
COMP 005 is making progress, but then back to COMP 005, have you had some patients transition into the open
label post six month, I guess it's part B or part C

So, we're not giving that sort of blow by blow detail on the recruitment. I think, Charles, we anticipate doing, you
know, quarterly updates on how the trials are going, but they're on track with their recruitment.

Okay. Got it. Got it. Why don't we move on in the last half an hour that we have? It says one, one minute, 40
seconds that we have to talk about PTSD because really, you brought it up earlier. Very interesting treatment
paradigm, evolving. Certainly some recent publications and perhaps other news coming in PTSD. Tell us about
the burden of disease there and why you might be excited. You have a small signal seeking study in PTSD. What
– what makes you excited about COMP360 in PTSD?

Yeah. So first of all, you mentioned the burden of disease, the unmet need. You know, this is a condition, PTSD,
that affects millions of people worldwide. And there – there really are not many treatment options at this point.

Largely it's, you know, follow-on indications from some SSRIs that have a PTSD indication that the best evidence
actually is more for psychological treatments than drug treatments at this point in that condition. You know, of
course, we talked earlier about [indiscernible] 00:27:26 program with MDMA therapy in PTSD. And, you know,
ultimately this is a population of patients that is going to need multiple this is a population of patients that is going
to the multiple new options.

And there may be one that – that says approval for the program. That is a fairly intensive one that that does
involve three administrations and 12 psychotherapy sessions for us in this small, largely safety focused study that
also does have some efficacy endpoints.

I think we're excited to see whether this may be a safe and well-tolerated treatment that if so, we can carry
forward and with a single administration in this study, could represent a lower resource intensive option in this
population with a big unmet need.

For that study, are you taking all comers in terms of quality etiology of PTSD or the cons? And secondarily, are
you allowing patients to be on some form of standard of care?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
Yeah. So in terms of etiology, there are many types of trauma that can result in somebody having PTSD.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Q
Yeah.

We are not focused on one specific type of trauma as the etiology.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Q
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
And then – and sorry, what's the second part of the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Q
Are you allowing patients to be on other – other medicine?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
Yeah. So like our TRD studies, this is a monotherapy study.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Q
Okay. Very good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A

It is. It's – it's really a quite small sample. And yeah, see if it's – we used to call it, Saturday morning boilerplate
studies in – in the lab. Anyway, this is this is fantastic. I'm not going to ask you the last question, which I already
know the answer to, which is if we're here together in a year, what are we going to be talking about.

Hopefully, it's going to be talking about fabulous results out of 005.
