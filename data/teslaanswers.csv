0,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you very much. And now let's go to investor questions. The first investor question comes from [ph] Craig
(00:11:08). How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?"
1,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"[ph] I struggle (00:11:16) to make an accurate guess at this point. Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp
is going to be extremely difficult. And it's like â€“ so there's no way around that. If you try to make â€“ if we just try to
do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the
combustion engine world, just distinctions without a difference, then it's really not that hard. But if you want to do
something radical and innovative and something really special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because
there's nothing to copy. You have to invent not just a car but the way to make the car.

So, the more uncharted the territory, less predictable the outcome. Now I can say that if you say, well, where will
things end up, I think we'll end up with roughly 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year. But I don't think we're going to
reach that output rate next year. But I think we'll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That's my best guess."
2,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularly progress
towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day? Thank you."
3,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. The next question from institutional investors, could you please provide an update on capacity
expansion plans for company's factories in Berlin and Austin and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?"
4,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. In Mexico, we're laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items, but I think
we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory.

I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in. I just can't emphasize this enough that the
vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. And as interest rates rise, the proportion of
that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally. So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher,
it's that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply cannot afford it.

And we are tracking, I believe, at this point for Model Y to be the best-selling car on earth, but not just in revenue
but in unit volume. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot,
they cost much less than our car. So, we're just hitting law of large numbers situations here.

I know people want us to advertise, and we are advertising. I think there is something to be gained on the
advertising front. I don't think it's nothing. But imploring people of a car that is great but they cannot afford doesn't
really help. So, that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable, or the average person
cannot buy it for any amount of money. They can't afford it. They can't afford it, so this is big deal."
5,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Okay. Thank you very much. The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the
US? I just wanted to address that unfortunately, we don't answer product-related questions and timings on
earnings calls, so let's go to the next one.

Current sell-side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth
versus 2023 guidance. Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024, and when does
Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?"
6,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thanks for the question. When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces. Elon just talked about what is
happening in the macroeconomic environment. So, we're focused on growing our volumes in a very cost-efficient
manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we'll be able to provide a much more meaningful update
at our next earnings call."
7,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever,
or you will exceed the mass of the known universe. But I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any
other car company on earth by far."
8,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. Next question is, do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the Robotaxi driven or non-driven?
What excites you most about how this project is progressing?"
9,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Well, the Robotaxi is, like, necessarily non-driven. I guess I am very excited about our progress with autonomy.
The end-to-end nothing but nets self-driving software is amazing. Drives me all around Austin with no
interventions, so it's clearly the right move. So, it's really pretty amazing. And also that same software and
approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking,
so extremely exciting in long term.

As I mentioned before, given that the company output is number of people times productivity, if you no longer
have a constraint on people, effectively you got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you'd like, your
economy is quasi-infinite or infinite for all intents and purposes. And I don't think anyone is going to do it better
than Tesla, not by a long shot.

Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a brain. They're like the Wizard of Oz or [ph] whatever
(00:20:45). And then you also need to be able to design humanoid robots in such a way that it can be mass
manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots. Now, so we need to make sure
that there's a good place for humans in that future and we do not create some variance of the Terminator
outcome. So we're going to put a lot of effort into localized controller for humanoid robots. So basically anyone will
be able to shut it off locally. And you can't change that even if you put like a software update, you can't change
that. That has to be hardcoded."
10,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and Tobotaxi is expected
so soon?"
11,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it, yeah. I think over time, the price of FSD will
increase proportionate to its value, so the current price has a kind of a temporary low."
12,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. The next question is again on FSD. Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3
autonomous driving system Drive Pilot is active. Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD? And if so,
when?"
13,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Well, there's a lot of people that assume we have legal liability, judging by the lawsuits. We're certainly not being
let off the hook on that front, whether we'd like to or wouldn't like to, so"
14,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"No, I think some people understand the profundity of a Tesla AI system. But it's very, very few. It's basically baby
AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive, baby AGI."
15,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. The next question on Optimus, will Optimus be working on Gigafactory lines next year? If so, how
many would you guess will be deployed?"
16,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"I think at this point, we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but we will make â€“ provide
periodic updates online. So, as you can see, where Optimus a year ago could barely walk, and now it can do
yoga, so a few years from now, it can probably do ballet."
17,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Sounds good. And the last question from investors is, neural net path planning represent a significant advance in
capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the US?"
18,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. Our approach has been to try to get it â€“ like the more places we try to make it work, the harder the problem
is. So, the reason we don't do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work
anywhere at all. So, that's why it's currently just North America.

And also, for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the US, you
can deploy things at risk, or at least you can take liability for what you're deploying. So it's a â€“ whereas most





countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So, we only want to go through that extensive
approval program when we think it's kind of ready for primetime in that country.

I apologize that it's not out in those countries, but we keep finding ways to make it better, and it needs to drive
such that it exceeds the even unsupervised â€“ significantly exceeds the probability of injury of a human or
significantly better, a lower probability of injury than a human by far. I think we're tracking to that point very
quickly.

Obviously, in the past, I've been overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimistic is that the
progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initial improvements, and then if
you were to extrapolate that sort of rapid fairly linear rate of improvement, you get to self-driving quite quickly. But
then, I think the rate of improvement curves over logarithmically and starts to asymptote.

That's now happened several times. I would characterize our progress in real-world AI as a series of stacked log
curves. I think that is also true in other parts of AI like LLMs and whatnot, series of stacked log curves. Each log
curve gets higher than the last one, but if you keep stacking them, keep stacking logs, eventually you get to FSD."
19,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Thank you. Let's now go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist. Will, please go
ahead and unmute yourself."
20,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production. It's kind of like the 18th month of production is
roughly my guess. So, it's just that they happen just â€“ it will happen"
21,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"I would be very disappointed if it took us â€“ it would be shocking if it took us three years. But 18 months from initial
deliveries to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense â€“ I can't tell you how much blood, sweat, and
tears level it required to achieve that. It's just staggering. I've been through it many times, and then here we go
again."
22,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"I mean, Cybertruck is"
23,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck. In general, nobody digs their grave better than themselves.
And so, Cybertruck is one of those really special products that comes along only once in a long while. And special
products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market to reach volume to be
prosperous. It's fundamental to the nature of the newness. So, now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller
vehicle is actually much more conventional."
24,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah.
25,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah, we did. There's significantly less parts on them."
26,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yes, exactly."
27,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"It is. Yes, it's â€“ the manufacturing approach for the high-volume small vehicle is revolutionary, but not
revolutionary quite in the same way as Cybertruck. I think it will be quite a fast ramp. So, as I was just saying,
we're doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a unit per minute level that is unheard
of in the auto industry."
28,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. Let's be clear, it will be cool but it's utilitarian. It's not meant to be â€“ fill you with awe and magic. It's
 (00:32:02), it will be still beautiful, but it's utilitarian â€“ it's a utility."
29,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah, that's an example. Yes. I mean, the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.





Martin Viecha
Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                             A
All right. Thank you very much. Let's go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research."
30,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yes.
31,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yes.
32,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, you know sort of the economics of a fully autonomous vehicle
are truly astounding in a positive way. When you look at [ph] past (00:34:30) vehicles today, they only get about
10 hours to 12 hours of usage per week. If you drive an hour and a half a day on average, that's roughly 10 hours
a week out of 168 hours. And then there's also you got to have parking and insurance, and you got to take care of
the car. It's like there's a lot of overhead. So â€“ I mean, yeah.

It's â€“ like the economics of the system are just insanely positive, given that all of the cars we're making and have
made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy. So, then if you're able to, say, increase the utility of
that car by, I don't know, a factor of five, which still only means that [ph] you'd been used (00:35:28) for maybe 50
hours a week out of 168 hours, so that still assumes less than a third of the hours of the week, it is doing





something useful. You've increased the value of that by five, but it still costs the same. Like you have something â€“
then we're a hardware company with software margins."
33,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"All right. Pierre, do you have a follow-up?"
34,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Hi, Pierre, thanks for that question. So, in terms of â€“ you have a few different aspects of your question. So, if I just
look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact. It did impact by â€“ I mean, I won't give you
the exact percentage, but it had decent impact for the quarter. And when you look at the other pieces which we're
trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, and they actually contributed pretty
well to the margin for this quarter. In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to, in terms of per unit costs, to
where we are for one of our other established factories, which is Fremont. So, that was a positive in the quarter.

When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there, and that product has done
well. I mean, on the cost curve also, we've been able to do a lot there. But I do want to caution that Megapack
deployments are a bit lumpy. So yes, we had a great quarter this period, but depending upon where we are trying
to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods wherein there would be downward pressure on
deployment because of us trying to get the product to that  (00:38:22)."
35,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah. Product in transit. Yeah.
36,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yes.
37,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah.
38,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Okay. Thank you very much. And let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod, feel free to unmute yourself."
39,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look into this. There are
certain things which we control and there are certain things which we don't control. We expect that we'll get some
benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are underway. And on the other hand, we just finished our factory
upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4. We're still not up to where we
want those factories to be severely impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we're going to be ramping
Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind which we look in dealing with.

On top of all that, there's overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to
predict precisely as to where we land. But just this is something which â€“ it's an evolving thing which we're
observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis."
40,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not â€“ we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional
cost-downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory
operations side. And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw. We're trying as hard as we
possibly can."
41,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Not at this time.
42,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"I think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean, to tell you frankly, if our car costs the same as a RAV4,
nobody would buy a RAV4, or at least that very unlikely to.

It's worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, that they're actually very difficult for
the average person to access because most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500 burning a hole in their
bank account. A large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and with a lot of debt. They got credit
card debt, mortgage debt. So, that's reality for most people. It's sometimes difficult for people who are high-
income earners. When I say high, it'd be like somebody who's earning over $200,000 a year to understand what
life is like for someone who is earning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.

So that like â€“ for a lot of people, like these tax credits just â€“ they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6
months to get â€“ for the tax credit, and they actually don't, in some cases, even have that $7,500 in taxes. So, it's
really just the vast majority of people is how much money do they have to pay immediately and how much per
month, that's it,  (00:43:08) right there. And our car is so much more expensive than a RAV4 when
you look at it that way."
43,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Now one other thing which I'll add, when you look at car buying in general, we're trying to get to the next set of EV
adaptors. When they use"
44,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Well, not an EV adaptor, just who wants a great car."
45,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,Exactly.
46,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"It's not â€“ sometimes, you get these like â€“ honestly, I'd say it's like somewhat correlates with the why-doesn't-
everyone-work-from-home crowd. I'm like, I mean, this is like some real [ph] Marie Antoinette vibes (00:43:48)
from people who say why doesn't everyone work from home. Like what about all the people that have to come to
the factory and build the cars? What about all the people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food
and deliver your food? It's like what are you talking about. I mean, how detached from reality does â€“ is the work-
from-home crowd have to be while they take advantage of all of those who do â€“ who cannot work from home? So
I mean, you have to say, like why did I sleep in the factory so many times? Because it mattered.

So I just can't emphasize enough how, again, how important cost is. It's not an optional thing for most people. It is
a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy it. And I keep harping on this
interest thing, but I mean, it just raises the cost of the car. I mean, we're looking at an internal analysis which I
know we â€“ like we think is more or less on track, that when you look at the cost â€“ or the price reductions we've
made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to how much people's monthly payment has risen due to interest
rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged."
47,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,If you factor in the change in interest rates.
48,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yes, which is â€“ that is what I'm trying to say. The thing that matters is the monthly pay â€“ it's how much money do
you have to put down and do that [ph] lift we (00:45:38) have that in their bank account or will the check bounce.
And then what is the monthly payment, and it doesn't matter how â€“ if that monthly payment is principal interest or
whatever, it's just a number, and that number has to not cause their bank account to go negative. That's it. So
going from near zero interest rates to the current very high interest rates, the actual monthly payment is basically
the same. It's just a bunch more of it is going to interest.

And there's some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has increased,
and so the number of people who simply cannot get credit, period. Even if they've got a job and everything's solid,
the banks are a little gun shy on handing out credit, given that a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year."
49,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. And there's also just fewer options. Even if they're able to hand down credit, there's fewer banks to go to."
50,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"It's like, does your bank still exist?"
51,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah.
52,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish a relationship with a new bank. And so, a lot of regional
banks are [ph] tight (00:46:56) and, I mean, even Credit Suisse. I mean, jeez, that was a shocker. Got a like 160
year old-ish Swiss institution that doesn't exist anymore. That's mind-blowing.

And I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation. I think commercial real estate
obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt has been rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are
usurious, probably over 20% interest rates, meaning like which over time, it just becomes obviously extremely
punishing. Because if somebody is paying 20% interest on their credit cards, it means they cannot pay them off.
And if you cannot pay them off and you're still accruing interest at 20%, that's headed to a bad place."
53,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,Thank you. Let's go to the next question from George from Canaccord.
54,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"We've not included radar. No. We have radar as â€“ a Tesla-designed radar is an experiment in the Model S/X.
That's it. We'll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrate radar into Model 3/Y.
Now just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety simply with
their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just with vision far, far, far, because, I mean, the car
is looking at all directions at once, we don't have eyes in the back of our head. And the computer never gets tired
and never gets distracted. Get drunk, hopefully.

And so, radar is â€“ what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. And in order for
the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking or you have to do actions that are radar-
only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision and radar. That's why we actually turned off
the radar in cars historically that we had shipped. All Model 3/Y used to radar but we turned it off because the
radar actually generated more noise than signal.

Now, the Tesla-designed radar is a high-resolution radar that has some potential to be useful, but the jury is still
very much out on whether that is in fact the case. On the cost saving?"
55,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"It's not like a one thing that â€“ you have to check cost everywhere, and we do it ruthlessly at all times."
56,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. I mean, I would say there's a whole lot of list of things which we are chasing. We internally call it the cost
attack where we're literally going line by line and saying how can we make it better. And it's a grind."
57,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"The grind.

 (00:51:40)"
58,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"It's like Game of Thrones but pennies. I mean, first approximation, if you've got a $40,000 car and roughly 10,000
items in that car, that means each thing on average costs $4. So in order to get the cost down, say, by 10%, you
have to get $0.40 out of each part on average. It is a game of pennies."
59,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,We play it religiously.
60,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. We've done it many, many times. And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there's too many
stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees. It's something as simple as a QR code. You might think, well,
putting a QR code on a part, why not just put them on there. It's like, well, are we actually going to use that QR
code?"
61,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah, exactly. And then inevitably, sometimes, the QR code doesn't go on properly or you can't read it properly
and then it stops the line."
62,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah, absolutely. It's chipping away with â€“ I mean, it is trying to â€“ it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at
times."
63,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah.
64,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,"On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up. That would also bring
some savings from higher production. Then on the flip side, we're going to be ramping a new product like
Cybertruck, which we talked about. So yeah, so those are the real puts and takes which we are working through."
65,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. But there's not like some accidentally some goal â€“ like a goal that we've left in the car, unfortunately, and
it's â€“ we're trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because any fool can
reduce the cost of the car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability, but that does sound
 (00:54:00) any fool. But like if you want to like lose weight and you say, well, I need to lose 15
pounds right away, well, you can chop your arm off but then you're sitting there with one arm. You're still fat. So
like"
66,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah. You actually have to eat less food and work out. That's the actual way.
67,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. So super fun because food is delicious, and personally, I don't love working out. I know some people do, I
wish I did, but I don't, unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.

All right. Let's go to Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, can you unmute yourself?"
68,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yes.
69,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,Yeah.
70,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"No. We're definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We've put a lot of effort into
looking at locations and feel very good about that location, and we are going to build a factory there and it's going
to be great.

The question is really just one of timing, and it's going to be a broken record on the interest front. It's just interest
rates have to come down. Like if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability. It is just the
same as increasing the price of the car. So, I just don't have visibility into it. If you can tell me what the interest
rates are, I can tell you when we should build the factory. We're going to build it, and I really think we'll start the
initial phase of construction next year.

But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. So â€“ well, that's now
14 years ago. That is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread
during that entire time. I mean, when we closed our financing round 2008 at 6:00 PM, December 24, Christmas
Eve, and if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas. So,
we actually closed that round on the last hour of the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and
then barely made it through 2009.

So, I'm like I want to just â€“ I don't want to be going at top speed into uncertainty. A lot of wars going on in the
world obviously as well. So, we have room here like in Giga Texas. We still have it in this building. It's not full with
Cybertruck and Model Y, and there's plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team
already is.






                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A
We also have 2,000 acres here."
71,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"We're obviously only occupying a tiny quarter of land that we own, but we could technically do all the scaling just
here. So I mean, personnel is our biggest challenge and that the Greater Austin area only has â€“ generously, the
Greater Austin area only has 2 million people. So if you are moving here and are they're willing to move here but
there is somewhat of a housing crisis, they got to live somewhere. So, yeah."
72,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"So, I don't know. I mean, I'm just curious â€“ like I'm not saying things will be bad. I'm just saying they might be. And
I think like Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure, like if the macroeconomic conditions are
stormy, even the best ship is still going to have tough times. The weaker ships will sink. We're not going to sink.
But even a great ship in a storm, it has challenges. That storm will apply to everyone, not just us and not just the
auto industry. It'll apply to everyone, I think, so apart from necessary sort of staples like food and stuff, but â€“ so I
just â€“ I don't know. If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate."
73,Martin Viecha,"Vice President-Investor Relations, Tesla, Inc.",A,All right.
74,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"If anybody's got any guesses on this, I'd love to be less wrong. And I apologize if I'm perhaps more paranoid than
I should be, because that might also be the case, because I have PTSD from 2009 big time, and then 2017
through 2019 were no picnic either. There was very tough going. So, the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic
because people tend to hesitate to buy a new car if there's uncertainty in the economy. So car companies do very
well in good economic times, and they don't do as well in tough economic times. So, it's â€“ whereas if somebody's
selling bread, then I think people still need to have bread. Yeah."
75,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. You need bread. We need food all the time, but new car, you don't have to have right this minute."
76,Vaibhav Taneja,"Chief Financial Officer, Tesla, Inc.",A,Especially if we have wars going on and then that impacts that sentiment.
77,Elon Reeve Musk,"Technoking, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Tesla, Inc.",A,"Yeah. I mean, if people are reading about wars all over the world, buying a new car tends to not be front of mind."
