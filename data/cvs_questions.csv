0,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"So, I'm going to start on the COVID topic with maybe a bit of a catch-all question, and I apologize, I'm probably
going to go beyond that after. But your business is unique relative to your peers and the fact that you have
offsetting parts tied to COVID. You have some areas that are performing well, vaccines, some of the dynamics on
immunization, some areas thy have had challenges [indiscernible] (00:01:25) the COVID costs. Where do we sit
right now in terms of where you think we are in return to normalization on some of those key metrics across your
overall enterprise relative to COVID and the various macro moving pieces?"
1,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"And that's an interesting question, debating the pivot to either benefits or retail, but starting on the retail side, in
terms of that future state of your care assets now against the backdrop of what you've discussed in terms of care
assets going forward. As you think about that infrastructure, and as we all sit and ponder and discuss what could
be that primary care strategy, both organic and inorganic growth, how are you positioning the assets that you
have now to make sure that you're capitalizing on the momentum you received, by so many more people coming
in for vaccines, for testing that maybe didn't use CVS â€“ CVS, the store or the MinuteClinic or HealthHUB,
whatever it is in the same way before COVID?"
2,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"And obviously, it's hard to put a fine point in terms of understanding the strategy without that kick start acquisition
that you"
3,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"mentioned could come along. That being said, you mentioned the convenience factor. And I think convenience
comes a number of different factors, but also has that quasi omni-channel approach to healthcare."
4,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"How do you think about the marrying of the physical assets with also your digital partnerships, your virtual
partnerships to make sure that that convenience factor can continue to be your members, your customers where
they are?"
5,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"And I know that you've talked about the strategy tied to be a multi-payer approach, but then again, you have one
of the greatest test labs possible with your HCB and the member base. So how do you think about the build-out of
the strategy against making it captive within that and making sure you get it right versus making sure that it's
ubiquitous to broader market?"
6,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"Turning to healthcare benefits a bit, in particular, the government business. You have two quasi divergent paths
and the fact that you've an MA business that's been seeing strong momentum for a number of years versus
Medicaid, which is in this quasi-odd periods, we wait to see what happens in the public health emergency and
what that means for a potential falloff in redeterminations. How do you think about positioning both of those
businesses for 2023 and 2024, in particular, against the backdrop of your guidance, given both the PHE dynamic,
as well as what's obviously a higher MA rate environment for this year?"
7,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"I may come back to this, but I want to turn to Pharmacy Services. I feel like virtually every earnings call, it's the yin
and the yang of Retail versus"
8,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,Health Care Benefits and the traditional [indiscernible] (00:16:49) kind of sits in the middle
9,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"Exactly. You outlined at the Investor Day back in December the biosimilar pipeline, which I know is taking on
increasing focus, HUMIRA being obviously the standout on that chart. When do you think you'll, as an
organization, have visibility into how HUMIRA will contribute to your overall earnings contribution rate?"
10,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"I might be a little early on this but relative to the Pharmacy Services and PBM, 2023 selling seasons kicked off,
especially as both payers and employers that you're participating RFPs with come to market in this post-COVID
world. Anything changing about the bid structure that you're seeing or what they're looking for as you're going to
try and continue what's been a fairly robust streak of wins?"
11,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"And are you seeing any changes in the approach or the attempts in RFPs for carve-in versus carve-out on
specialty? And how does that factor in, in terms of the ask, given that you do have the largest specialty pharmacy
by a pretty wide margin?"
12,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"Turning to the Retail side again, where do we stand on pharmacy reimbursement and how is that contemplated,
in particular, into your 2023 and 2024 targets?"
13,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"And within the stores as well, I mean, mostly at least, wage inflation has been a big component of discussion.
You've been very forthright on $600 million of annualized wage investments. Do you feel at this point in time like
you have enough of a feedback loop to know that that's enough for your employee base?"
14,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"And I want to make sure I hit on this because I've asked about it in bunch of different ways. But on the longer term
targets, CVS has evolved as an enterprise, talks about the puts and takes on COVID and, of course, non-COVID
areas of the business as well. As you think about your long-term targets and making sure that you're â€“ the team is
staying on track on those goals, how do you balance the dynamics of areas where there could be unexpected or
uncontrollable variability? And how you think through the best way to provide visibility for the organization as a
whole on whatever offsets you have to make sure that those targets stay on track?"
15,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"I wish we're all that good at forecasting, but"
16,Michael Cherny,"Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.",Q,"like, it's a two-point buffer is never a bad thing."
