0,Geoff Meacham,"Analyst, BofA Securities",Q,"Hi, guys. Geoff Meacham, BofA. I've a couple of questions. The first is on the combo with you with COVID and flu.
And as you've derisked the combination, how has your thinking evolved to comp the price? And when you look at
flu, obviously it's pretty well established. It's not a particularly high bar, but you're offering a lot of value with the
COVID piece. But that's sort of a less certain market. So that's the first question.

Second question, on the oncology piece, I think that you guys have a pretty productive platform to go from â€“ go
into Phase 1. How important is it strategically to look at new novel targets in oncology that you could combine? I
feel like the INT the personalized piece of it is pretty straightforward, but the discovery, target discovery is
obviously a pretty big research effort."
1,Geoff Meacham,"Analyst, BofA Securities",Q,Okay. Thanks you.
2,Michael J. Yee,"Analyst, Jefferies LLC",Q,"Hey, guys. Michael Yee from Jefferies. Maybe an easier question and then maybe a slightly tougher question.
The easier question is just on flu. I noticed that you said you still sort of need to talk with regulators. What do you
need to get agreement on? When would we know that? And is there absolutely any risk at all that they wouldn't let
you file accelerated on flu? Maybe talk to that and the chronology of when we would know about flu.

And then the tougher question maybe is just, there was obviously a lot of discussion around your confidence in
jabs and vaccines, utilization. Obviously it's very sensitive to the vaccine rates. Under what scenarios do you think
if that didn't come in at where you think that's going to come in this year or even next year that you guys feel right-
sized about your expenses and the growing expenses? This year as a year, where there's supposed to be EPS
negative maybe that gets tougher next year. So under what scenarios do you think about that doesn't really
matter?"
3,Evan Wang,"Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC",Q,"Hey, I'm Evan Wang from Guggenheim. Exciting data in flu, great improvements on B strains. So, I guess, how
are you thinking about this combine with P302 data which I think still had preliminary eight cases, should this
updated formulation translate to improve the efficacy in  (02:57:47) standard flu or hand flu? If not I
guess how you guys think about next steps towards kind of evaluating that at the head trial with either mRNA-
1010 or next-gen program?

And I have a second question on oncology following the data from ACR and ASCO. Have you approached
regulators on kind of what's required for accelerated approval, I guess, both for adjuvant melanoma and to
support approvals in lung cancer and  (02:58:19) candidate? Thanks."
4,Salveen Richter,"Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC",Q,"Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. So just a follow up on that last point. I think you've talked about the three-
year data coming by year end for the INT program, but also the interim look that will come at â€“ at, I believe,
 (03:01:26). So, have you â€“ I mean, have you â€“ do you have a sense of what the regulators want to
see from those two data sets or is it the first one kind of gets you to that discussion point.

And then just a broader question, when we think of this oncology vertical where historically you've talked about
how you would really need to unlock a vertical before you fully invest in it and cancer's risky. Talk to us about the
INT work and how that translates to your Triplet as well as the checkpoint vaccine. And then why you are now
starting to do these partnerships that are a bit more peripheral? Thank you."
5,Gena Wang,"Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.",Q,"Gena Wang from Barclays. I have three questions. The first one is mRNA-1010. Now, you show very impressive
data. I'm wondering, will you be able to share that improved formulation, what is that, If you can share with us.

And second question is regarding the combo vaccine. So, has FDA already aligned with you regarding the
approval path, and what exactly kind of data you need to show?





And lastly is INT non-small cell lung cancer Phase 3 trial design. Can you share with us regarding the target
patient population in terms of the stage of the disease?"
6,Tyler van Buren,"Analyst, TD Cowen",Q,"Hey, guys. Tyler van Buren, TD Cowen. Thank you very much for the presentation. Have a couple. The first one
is, with the list price for the COVID-19 booster announced for the fall season, can you give us more precision on
what the net price might look like relative to the $64 to $100 range you guys previously announced?

And then, the second one is on CMV. Since it's fully enrolled, not too many investors pay attention to that
program. So what's your best guess when we'll get top line data? And can you describe the magnitude of the
opportunity relative to, say, RSV and why investors should be so excited about it?"
7,Hartaj Singh,"Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.",Q,"Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Company. First, just want to thank you all for a really nice presentation. I don't
think â€“ I think very â€“ few none of your biopharma peers actually give the breadth and the depth of presentations
you all tend to do 3, 4, 5 times a year. So I really appreciate it.

Couple of specific questions. I think that, Jackie, you had mentioned earlier that the implementation of the bivalent
is going to help you with the combos. You might have answered this already question before, but how so
specifically, with the COVID-19 bivalent, how is it going can help you with the combos in the future? And then a
follow-on to that is one of the gentlemen previously had talked about how you monitor seasonality and variance
currently. With the combos, how would that change and how would you able â€“ to be able to shift that into your
combo vaccines? Thank you."
8,Jessica Fye,"Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC",Q,"Hey, good afternoon. Jess Fye, JPMorgan. For RSV, can you just talk about what you see as the key
differentiating features of your products profile and also maybe talk about how you envision that market taking
shape in the context of shared clinical decision making?"
9,Edward Tenthoff,"Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.",Q,"Great. Thank you. Ted Tenthoff, Piper Sandler. Just following up on some of the data that you showed with
respect to the rare disease franchise, can you paint what the picture looks like for where we go from here? I know
you were talking about  (03:21:56), but what could registrational trials look like in those orphan
settings? And how different would PA, MMA be versus PKU, for example, where there's already some therapies
there?"
10,Mani Foroohar,"Analyst, SVB Leerink",Q,"Yeah. Thanks for the very thorough presentation. Mani Foroohar, Leerink Partners.. A couple of questions on the
financial side. You talked about the relevance of US vaccine volumes to the guidance this year. How do you think
about what data you gather from jab volume in the US this 4Q and the extent to which you read that forward into
next year and future seasons? Is it fairly linear as Pfizer has suggested on their calls or do you think each season
kind of has its own character and you're going to see multiple endemic years before you start assuming what a
run rate would be? And I've got one more question."
11,Mani Foroohar,"Analyst, SVB Leerink",Q,"And a follow-up on the expense infrastructure and the flexing that you talked about around thinking about how to
think about clinical trial results, et cetera, different franchises. Can you give us a sense of on SG&A, R&D and
COGS respectively, like how much time does it take to flex up or down based upon what we see with the COVID
business this year? Does it take a year to flex down because you've got contracts with suppliers on the R&D and
SG&A side? How nimble can you be in terms of scaling up or down? Obviously, you can't just send people home.
It takes time to resize your head count. Like how quickly could you pivot in either direction?"
12,Mani Foroohar,"Analyst, SVB Leerink",Q,That's to you.
13,Steve Chesney,"Analyst, Redburn Atlantic",Q,"Hi. Steve Chesney from Redburn Atlantic. Just two quick ones for me. Just thinking about the opportunity in the
high efficacy flu vaccine space, what are your thoughts around the need for hospitalization data as you eventually
approach payers? And then on the COVID vaccine side, it sounds like you've made a lot of progress on
contracting. Could you provide any updated thoughts on the contract dynamics in terms of how returns would be
handled? And then just on the cadence of revenue recognition into the third and fourth quarter. Thanks."
