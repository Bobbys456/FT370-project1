Yeah. And to the second question, I think that's exactly what I was trying to articulate earlier, which is we look at
our capital and we look at the strength of every annual business here. And we have scenarios. Our base plan is
$25 billion. Should it not be – should the strength of this core business not achieve what we think is probably





lower than $25 billion? Should it be higher? We actually might invest a little bit more than $25 billion. So, we
definitely look at those plans. And right now we think we feel comfortable that – that's our best guess in terms of
the R&D investment.So maybe I'll start with cost of goods sold andSG&A. I'll let Stephen talk about  (03:28:01). So we believe we can act pretty quickly in both
categories. Number one, we use a lot of outside services and partners. It's easier to shut that down. That's a
substantial portion and it's not a long-term contract.

On the cost of goods sold side, as I mentioned, it'll take a little bit of time. And I think extra volume, the
combinations, that'll help us achieve our overall 75% to 80% gross margin. But you'll see a marked step from
2023 to 2024 in terms of our cost of goods sold percent. So we might not get the entire way there, but we're
taking steps to do it. And same thing on the SG&A side.Yeah, sure. No change. At the last earnings call, we guided that about 30% of our revenue in the second half
would be recognized in the third quarter, which then 70% in the fourth quarter. So still sticking to that.
