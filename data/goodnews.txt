All right.
It's not a class effect.
So in terms of the design of the lung cancer study, so I can't give you specifics around the design, because we're
waiting with our colleagues at Merck to unveil the specifics of the design. What I can tell you, though, it's an
adjuvant population. So what that means is, you wouldn't expect Stage 4s, you wouldn't expect Stage 1s. So
that's probably as much as I can share. And Michelle, you think we should share any more?
So maybe I'll take the first part of the question on contracts. From a contracting perspective, there is â€“ depending
on the customer in the segment, we do have different [ph] returnability (03:31:09) clauses. I'd say this year going
into a commercial market is probably the most sort of uncertain year from a customer perspective on total
demand that we've been working closely with them on, depending on the size of the contract and the customer. In
terms of the Q3, Q4 revenue recognition, do you want to take that one?
Okay. It'll be out very, very soon. Thank you.
