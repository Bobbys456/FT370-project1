Thank you very much. And now let's go to investor questions. The first investor question comes from [ph] Craig
(00:11:08). How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?
Yes.
Yeah.
Especially if we have wars going on and then that impacts that sentiment.
Yeah. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look into this. There are
certain things which we control and there are certain things which we don't control. We expect that we'll get some
benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are underway. And on the other hand, we just finished our factory
upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4. We're still not up to where we
want those factories to be severely impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we're going to be ramping
Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind which we look in dealing with.

On top of all that, there's overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to
predict precisely as to where we land. But just this is something which â€“ it's an evolving thing which we're
observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.
