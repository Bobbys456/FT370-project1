0,William Stein,"Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.",Q,"Great. Thanks so much for taking my question, and thanks for all the updates today. We learned earlier in the call,
it sounds like you don't think the truck will ramp to significant volume until its third year of production. Should we
have a similar anticipation for the ramp of the next-gen platform? Or is there any reason that we should be maybe
more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there? Thank you."
1,William Stein,"Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.",Q,Similar path for the next-gen platform?
2,Rod Lache,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC",Q,"Thanks. Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took. You've taken
now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle cost over the past year. Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate
of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded to? Is there a
way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here? And then related to that, can
you share the timing of your next-gen â€“ the lower priced product that you talked about earlier this year?"
3,Rod Lache,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC",Q,"The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?"
4,Rod Lache,"Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC",Q,"Okay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that's obviously not happening in a
vacuum. And you mentioned that â€“ I think you mentioned that at some point during this call, that you're also
maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you just share how you're thinking about
price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment, and any thoughts along those lines?"
5,George Gianarikas,"Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC",Q,"Thank you for taking my question. Just to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters, as you
discussed in your written remarks, I'm curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factory
utilization, is it material cost reductions, the things like gigacasting? I mean, could you just kind of give us some
data points to give us confidence that that's going to come down over time?

And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports, and I know how perilous it is to believe some of these.
But they say that you've included radar as an option in some Model Y's in China, and I'm just here to ask if that's
true, and if so, why? Thank you."
6,Colin Langan,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC",Q,Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?
7,Colin Langan,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC",Q,"Great. Thanks for taking my question. You said in the commentary that you're not going full tilt on the plant in
Mexico until there are signs that the economy is strong. Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? And
where would that come from? And any color on what you mean sort of not going full tilt? Could that plant get
delayed indefinitely or what are you kind of talking about?"
8,Colin Langan,"Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC",Q,Okay. Excellent.
